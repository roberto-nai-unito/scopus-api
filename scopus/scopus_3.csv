The electronic government has become a trend for transforming public management to comply with the performance of an efficient, modern state. The processes for public procurement and personnel recruitment represent an essential fraction of a country's public spending. Objective. Maturity models are tools for assessing different management dimensions resulting in some level of organizational maturity on an ordinal scale which can show null, partial, or total progress towards the desired state. This paper presents an e-government maturity model for public procurement and personnel recruitment processes, based on a literature review to determine the current state of research in the field. Methodology. We have used a known procedural model from Becker to support the design of the proposed model. Later on, we have tested it with government buyers and personnel recruiters. Findings. These initial results show that users understand the questionnaires designed for the study, and their answers allow us to obtain deep validation. A tool with these characteristics can be handy for measuring the degree of transparency in public entities, thus reducing corruption levels in their processes. Conclusion. This proposal describes the complexity of variables that influence the transparency of a socio-technical process in public tenders. We describe five levels of transparency for software procurement through development projects. These classifications enable the maturity levels of the transparency of electronic procedures used by government agencies to be measured in different dimensions. Implications. One of the crucial challenges to increasing a government's transparency is defining a regulatory or legal framework that regulates its processes and allows the levels of transparency or corruption to be measured in its different departments. Thus instruments and metrics play a crucial role in monitoring the expected change. With direct application in the industry, a model is an essential step for fundamental transparency in electronic governments. © 2013 IEEE.;"E-government; Maturity models; Procurement; Public tenders; Transparency";"Biological systems; Personnel; Surveys; Biological system modeling; e-Government; Electronicgovernment (e-government); Maturity model; Procurement; Proposal; Public tender; Recruitment; Systematic; Transparency";"(2020) Corruption Perceptions Index, , Transparency Int.

Worldwide, collusion is a pervasive phenomenon in public sector procurement. It undermines the benefits of a competitive marketplace and wastes taxpayers' money. More often than not, contracting authorities cannot identify non-competitive bids and frequently award contracts at higher prices than they would have in collusion's absence. This paper tests the accuracy of eleven Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for detecting collusion using collusive datasets obtained from Brazil, Italy, Japan, Switzerland and the United States. While the use of ML in public procurement remains largely unexplored, its potential use to identify collusion are promising. ML algorithms are quite information-intensive (they need a substantial number of historical auctions to be calibrated), but they are also highly flexible tools, producing reasonable detection rates even with a minimal amount of information. © 2021;"Auction; Collusion; Construction; Contracting; Machine learning; Procurement";"Commerce; Costs; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Collusion; Collusion detection; Competitive marketplace; Contracting; Illegal practices; Machine learning algorithms; Procurement; Procurement auction; Public procurement; Public sector procurements; Taxation";"Curtis, F., Maines, P., Closed competitive bidding (1973) Omega., 1, pp. 613-619; Signor, R., Love, P.E.D., Oliveira, A., Lopes, A.O., Oliveira, P.S., Public infrastructure procurement: detecting collusion in capped first-priced auctions (2020) J.

BIM allows the construction of a digital scale model of the asset to be built, ensuring the early detection of conflicts and interferences, enabling communication between the different participant agents, and facilitating the processes in the maintenance and management phase. Studies on the subject are many and varied. However, very few works refer to the inclusion of BIM in the public procurement stage, one of the most complex and competitive stages within the asset’s life cycle. A bibliographic review has been conducted about the BIM situation in the AECO sector contracts, the existing problems and the possible solutions to implement. In the specific field of public procurement, Spain has made great progress, especially at the regional level. During 2020, a total of 440 tenders with BIM requirements were published, with an investment volume of EUR 752 million, which represents an increase of 230% compared to 2017. The aim of this research is to analyze the Spanish public procurement, highlighting the progress made so far in the implementation of this technology, as well as to develop a proposal of BIM requirements that, in general, could be used as a reference for tenders of the AECO sector in the country. With this objective, a selection of twenty relevant public tenders is made, covering both the building and infrastructure fields. The requirements address areas such as: BIM uses, BIM deliverables, model structure, Level of Development, Common Data Environment, classification systems, standards or quality control. © 2021 by the authors.

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a dataset consisting of 300 patient scans was used for model assessment; 150 patient scans were from the competition set and 150 were from an independent dataset. Both test datasets contained 50 cancer-positive scans and 100 cancer-negative scans. The reference standard was set by histopathologic examination for cancer-positive scans and imaging follow-up for at least 2 years for cancer-negative scans. The test datasets were applied to the three top-performing algorithms from the Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017 public competition: grt123, Julian de Wit and Daniel Hammack (JWDH), and Aidence. Model outputs were compared with an observer study of 11 radiologists that assessed the same test datasets. Each scan was scored on a continuous scale by both the deep learning algorithms and the radiologists. Performance was measured using multireader, multicase receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.877 (95% CI: 0.842, 0.910) for grt123, 0.902 (95% CI: 0.871, 0.932) for JWDH, and 0.900 (95% CI: 0.870, 0.928) for Aidence. The average AUC of the radiologists was 0.917 (95% CI: 0.889, 0.945), which was significantly higher than grt123 (P =.02); however, no significant difference was found between the raologists and JWDH (P =.29) or Aidence (P =.26). Conclusion: Deep learning algorithms developed in a public competition for lung cancer detection in low-dose CT scans reached performance close to that of radiologists. © RSNA, 2021.";;"algorithm; Article; cancer diagnosis; clinical trial (topic); deep learning; follow up; histopathology; human; lung cancer; observer bias; questionnaire; radiologist; receiver operating characteristic; x-ray computed tomography";"The top 10 causes of death, , https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death, World Health Organization.

This study identifies processes with anomalies and generates a model for detecting possible corruption in the assignment of process qualification parameters in public procurement. A multi-phase model was used (the identification of anomalies and generation of the detection model), which uses different algorithms, such as clustering (K-Means), Self-Organizing map (SOM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). SOM was used to determine the level of influence of each rating parameter, K-Means to create groups by clustering, semi-supervised learning with SVM and PCA to generate a model to detect anomalies in the processes. By means of a case study, four groups of processes were obtained, highlighting the presence of the group “null economic offer” where the values for the economic offer do not exceed 1%, and a greater weight is given to other qualification parameters, which include direct contracting. The processes in this cluster are considered anomalous. Following this methodology, a semi-supervised learning model is built for the detection of anomalies, which obtains an accuracy of 95%, allowing the detection of procedures where the aim is to benefit a particular supplier by means of the qualification assignment parameters. © 2021 by the authors.

However, this approach relies on massive annotated samples, and the problem of limited generalization for unseen images still remains. The manual pixel-level labeling process is also extremely time-consuming, and the performance of CNNs degrades significantly when there is a domain gap between the training and test images. In this paper, to address this problem, a global-local adversarial learning (GOAL) framework is proposed for cross-domain road detection. On the one hand, considering the spatial information similarities between the source and target domains, feature space driven adversarial learning is applied to explore the shared features across domains. On the other hand, the complex background of VHR remote sensing images, such as the occlusions and shadows of trees and buildings, makes some roads easy to recognize, while others are much more difficult. However, the traditional global adversarial learning approach cannot guarantee local semantic consistency. Therefore, a local alignment operation is introduced, which adaptively adjusts the weight of the adversarial loss according to the road recognition difficulty. Extensive experiments were conducted on different road datasets, including two public competition road datasets—SpaceNet and DeepGlobe—and our own large-scale annotated images from four cities: Boston, Birmingham, Shanghai, and Wuhan. The experimental results show that the proposed GOAL framework can clearly improve the cross-domain road detection performance, without any annotation of the target domain images. For instance, taking SpaceNet road dataset as the source domain, compared with the no adaptation method, the IOU performance of GOAL framework is increased by 14.36%, 5.49%, 4.51%, 5.63% and 15.14% on DeepGlobe, Boston, Birmingham, Shanghai, and Wuhan images, respectively, which demonstrates its strong generalization capability. © 2021 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

For this purpose, we propose using Neutrosophic Sociology or Neutrosociology, to use an indeterminate membership function that allows modeling the unawareness, doubts, and contradictions that may exist in the answers of any human being. The results obtained showed that the city of Guayaquil identifies as the main cause of acts of corruption in public procurement during the COVID 19 health emergency in the country: the interference of public servants as partners in different companies supply medical supplies. However, it does not recognize as a possible cause the existence of legal gaps in the public procurement norm. © 2021. Neutrosophic Sets and Systems.

Theoretically, we explore the governance role played by organized criminal groups in corruption networks, facilitating corrupt transactions by lowering search costs, bargaining costs, and enforcement cots. Empirically, the analysis exploits a rare empirical setup of proven cases of both EGO presence and absence in contract awards by Italian municipalities. We use traditional regression and supervised machine-learning methods for identifying and validating proxy indicators for EGO presence in public procurement such as single bidding or municipal spending concentration. Internal validity of our models is very high, 85% of unseen contracts are correctly classified. External validity is moderate, our predicted EGO presence score correlates with established indicators of organized criminality across the whole of Italy and Europe with a linear correlation coefficient of about 0.4. © 2021 The Authors.

This research was conducted empirically by involving 265 respondents from accountants, stakeholders, civil servants and inspectors in Central Java, Indonesia who were analyzed by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS analysis tools. The theoretical test results confirm the fraud triangle and the theory of planned behavior to study the opportunity and financial process factors and the rationalization factor which emphasizes the moral psychological aspects. In practical terms, these findings underline the need for tiered supervision in the implementation of goods and services procurement projects in the public sector, improve the quality of reporting and accounting systems, and improve individual integrity to carry out work. Also, it is necessary to increase the remuneration of employees and provide competitive pricing for the private sector involved in procurement projects to minimize intentions for corruption and corrupt behavior by improving the quality of life of the individuals involved in supervision, auditing and reporting. © 2021, Growing Science.

With the proliferation of e-procurement systems in the public sector, anti-corruption agencies and watchdog organizations have access to valuable sources of information with which to identify transactions that are likely to become troublesome and why. In this article, we discuss the promises and challenges of using machine learning models to predict inefficiency and corruption in public procurement. We illustrate this approach with a dataset with more than two million public procurement contracts in Colombia. We trained machine learning models to predict which of them will result in corruption investigations, a breach of contract, or implementation inefficiencies. We then discuss how our models can help practitioners better understand the drivers of corruption and inefficiency in public procurement. Our approach will be useful to governments interested in exploiting large administrative datasets to improve the provision of public goods, and it highlights some of the tradeoffs and challenges that they might face throughout this process. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters;"Corruption; Forecasting; Inefficiency; Machine learning; Public procurement";;"Acevedo, K.M., Bornacelly, I.D., Panel municipal del CEDE (2014), Universidad de los Andes-CEDE; Ades, A., Tella, R.D., Rents, competition and corruption (1999) American Economic Review, 89 (4), pp. 982-993; Adsera, A., Boix, C., Payne, M., Are you being served?

It is estimated that between 2% and 5% of the global GDP is lost annually because of such practices, not only directly impacting public services and private sector development but also strengthening organized crime. However, most law enforcement agencies do not have the capability to carry out systematic corruption risk assessment leveraging on the availability of data related to public procurement. The currently prevailing approach employed by Brazilian law enforcement agencies to detect companies involved in potential cases of fraud consists in receiving circumstantial evidence or complaints from whistleblowers. As a result, a large number of companies involved in fraud remain undetected and unprosecuted. The decision support system (DSS) described in this work addresses these existing limitations by providing a tool for systematic analysis of public procurement. It allows the law enforcement agencies to establish priorities concerning the companies to be investigated. This DSS incorporates data mining algorithms for quantifying dozens of corruption risk patterns for all public contractors inside a specific jurisdiction, leading to improvements in the quality of public spending and to the identification of more cases of fraud. These algorithms combine operations research tools such as graph theory, clusterization, and regression analysis with advanced data science methods to allow the identification of the main risk patterns, such as collusion between bidders, conflicts of interest (e.g., a politician who owns a company contracted by the same government body where he or she was elected), and companies owned by a potentially straw person used for disguising its real owner (e.g., beneficiaries of cash conditional transfer programs). The DSS has already led to a detailed analysis of large public procurement datasets, which add up to more than 50 billion dollars. Moreover, the DSS provided strategic inputs to investigations conducted by federal and state agencies. © 2020 The Authors.

This has motivated entities to promote anti-corruption strategies, most of these strategies are manual and social in nature. In order to effectively (efficiently and efficiently) predict and detect corruption, it is necessary to carry out automatic processes. This review seeks to establish the fundamental concepts of the state of the art related to solutions that apply anti-corruption strategies and based on this, analyze the feasibility of creating a model for detecting and identifying corruption in the public procurement process. The results show that combining statistical techniques with information technologies (artificial intelligence, big data, data mining, among others) is a promising line of research in this area of application. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop specific automatic models for the detection of the different crimes of corruption in contracting. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

In Indonesia, there are seven types of corruption cases handled by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). One of the corruption cases which is detrimental to the state occurs in public procurement, such as the procurement of goods/services. This case is the second most corrupt crime after bribery in Indonesia. In this research, wetry to identify potential corruption from auction data on goods/services procurement in government.

In this study we evaluate how medium- and large-sized mammals cope in these human-modified landscapes in the Paraguayan Dry Chaco, where by state law at least 25% of forest cover must be preserved. Using a camera-trap approach, we studied how the surrounding vegetation matrix and season (dry or rainy) influence the pattern of occurrence and detectability of species around artificial water reservoirs for cattle supply. We registered 26 mammal species, and the responses of 14 different species were modelled. Five species (Tayassu pecari, Leopardus pardalis, Pecari tajacu, Mazama gouazoubira and Myrmecophaga tridactyla) showed a positive response to forest cover, with T. pecari and L. pardalis being extremely sensitive to deforestation. Also, forest cover showed a positive effect on the detectability of Tapirus terrestris and Puma concolor. By contrast, for two generalist canids, Lycalopex gymnocercus and Cerdocyon thous, and the semiaquatic Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris forest cover negatively influenced species detectability. Cattle ranches have the potential to maintain a substantial part of the original chacoan fauna, with forest cover being a main factor in structuring the mammal assemblages found around water reservoirs. Additionally, in ten species there was a moderate to strong increase in the probability of detection around water reservoirs during the dry season. The conservation of large forest tracts combined with strict compliance with poaching bans are key management strategies for the conservation of mammal diversity in the human-altered landscapes of the Chaco. © 2020 The Authors;"Camera-traps; Deforestation; Land conversion; Mammal biodiversity; Mammal conservation; Occupancy modelling";;"Altrichter, M., Wildlife in the life of local people of the semi-arid Argentine Chaco (2006) Biodivers.

In this paper, we use as a case study the public procurement data from Paraguay, available in the open data format of the Open Contracting Data Standard, to train an unsupervised learning model for anomaly detection based on the Isolation Forest algorithm. The Open Contracting Data Standard allows the developed technique to be replicated in other countries that implement the same data standard, thus achieving an interoperable solution. The resulting classification enables the scoring of contracts and procurement processes which can be used to identify anomalies and make it possible to obtain an intelligent sampling of the data. This can be utilized as a support in the task of the government in its role to regulate and control the public procurements. The effectiveness of the model is validated with local known anomalous procurement processes, which are: a)processes protested by entities involved in the contracting process, which were determined in favor of the protestant, and b)complaints about the contracting process from external entities with the possibility of anonymity. The results show an accuracy of over 90 % in detecting these known anomalies as early as in the tender stage and during the contracting stage. Thus indicating a feasible approach for anomaly detection in public procurements. © 2020 IEEE.;"Anomaly Detection; Artificial Intelligence; Data Mining; Open Contracting; Open Data";"Open Data; Contracting process; Data standards; Intelligent samplings; Paraguay; Procurement process; Public funds; Public procurement; Quality of life; Anomaly detection";"Auriol, E., Flochel, T., Straub, S., Public procurement and rent-seeking: The case of Paraguay (2011) TSE Working Papers 11-224, Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), , Feb; Wang, Y., Detecting fraud in public procurement (2016) Stony Brook Theses and Dissertations Collection, 8; https://www.open-contracting.org/resources/red-flags-integrity-giving-green-light-open-data-solutions/, O.

In order to minimize human intervention, table detection and table structure detection form the essential functionality. However, a self-contained holistic solution to extract the tables as well as their columns and rows in not readily available. To address this challenge, This study presents a new formal procedure that consists of the following sequence: table detection, structure segmentation and holistic tabular structure detection on documents. The proposed table detection model outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by achieving a recall value of 1.0 and a precision of more than 0.99 on public competition datasets. Furthermore, this work introduces a judging mechanism and an agreement-based post-processing procedure to incorporate hand-crafted rules into the deep learning models. Though the individual components achieve a new state-of-the-art F1-Score, when integrated the best achieved F-measure for the holistic system is 0.89. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;"Deep learning; Document processing; Image processing; Page object detection; Structure detection; Table detection; Tabular data extraction";"Data mining; Image processing; Information management; Supply chains; Document-processing; Human intervention; Individual components; Post-processing procedure; Structure detection; Structure segmentation; Table detection; Tabular data; Deep learning";"Canny, J., A computational approach to edge detection (1987) Readings in Computer Vision, pp. 184-203. , Elsevier; Cesarini, F., Marinai, S., Sarti, L., Soda, G., Trainable table location in document images (2002) Object Recognition Supported by User Interaction for Service Robots, Vol. 3, pp. 236-240. , IEEE; Fang, J., Gao, L., Bai, K., Qiu, R., Tao, X., Tang, Z., A table detection method for multipage pdf documents via visual seperators and tabular structures (2011) 2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pp. 779-783. , IEEE; Gilani, A., Qasim, S.R., Malik, I., Shafait, F., Table detection using deep learning (2017); Girshick, R., (2015), pp. 1440-1448. , Fast r-cnn.

Digital technologies that can detect and prevent fraud and corruption are particularly important to address barriers to access to medicines, such as medicines availability and affordability, stockouts, shortages, diversion, and infiltration of substandard and falsified medicines. Objectives: To better understand how digital technologies are used to combat corruption, increase transparency, and detect fraud in pharmaceutical procurement systems to improve population health outcomes. Methods: We conducted a multidisciplinary review of the health/medicine, engineering, and computer science literature. Our search queries included keywords associated with medicines procurement and digital technology in combination with terms associated with transparency and anti-corruption initiatives. Our definition of ‘digital technology’ focused on Internet-based communications, including online portals and management systems, supply chain tools, and electronic databases. Results: We extracted 37 articles for in-depth review based on our inclusion criteria focused on the utilization of digital technology to improve medicines procurement. The vast majority of articles focused on electronic data transfer and/or e-procurement systems with fewer articles discussing emerging technologies such as machine learning and blockchain distributed ledger solutions. In the context of e-procurement, slow adoption, justifying cost-savings, and need for technical standards setting were identified as key challenges for current and future utilization. Conclusions: Though there is a significant promise for digital technologies, particularly e-procurement, overall adoption of solutions that can enhance transparency, accountability and concomitantly combat corruption, is still underdeveloped. Future efforts should focus on tying cost-saving measurements with anti-corruption indicators, prioritizing centralization of e-procurement systems, establishing regulatory harmonization with standards setting, and incorporating additional anti-corruption technologies into procurement processes for improving access to medicines and to reach the overall goal of Universal Health Coverage. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Federal Police and audit agencies investigate collusion (bid-rigging), over-pricing, and delivery fraud in this field and efforts have been employed to early detect fraud and collusion on public works procurements. The current automatic methods of fraud detection use structured data to classification and usually do not involve annotated data. The use of NLP for this kind of application is rare. Our work introduces a new dataset formed by public procurement calls available on Brazilian official journal (Diário Oficial da União), using by 15,132,968 textual entries of which 1,907 are annotated risky entries. Both bottleneck deep neural network and Bi-LSTM shown competitive compared with classical classifiers and achieved better precision (93.0% and 92.4%, respectively), which signs improvements in a criminal fraud investigation. ©2020 Association for Computational Linguistics;;"Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Deep neural networks; Long short-term memory; Natural language processing systems; 'current; Automatic method; Bid rigging; Federal police; Fraud detection; Public procurement; Structured data; Crime";"Abadi, Martín, Agarwal, Ashish, Barham, Paul, Brevdo, Eugene, Chen, Zhifeng, Citro, Craig, Corrado, Greg S., Zheng, Xiaoqiang, (2015) TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems, , Software tensorflow.org; Altman, Naomi S, An introduction to kernel and nearest-neighbor nonparametric regression (1992) The American Statistician, 46 (3), pp. 175-185; Alvarez, Jose María, Labra, José Emilio, Marín, Ángel, Marín, José Luis, Semantic methods for reusing linking open data of the european public procurement notices (2011) ESWC PhD Symposium; Alvarez-Rodríguez, Jose María, Vafopoulos, Michalis, Llorens, Juan, Enabling policy making processes by unifying and reconciling corporate names in public procurement data. the corfu technique (2015) Computer Standards & Interfaces, 41, pp. 28-38; Anysz, Hubert, Foremny, Andrzej, Kulejewski, Janusz, Comparison of ann classifier to the neurofuzzy system for collusion detection in the tender procedures of road construction sector (2019) IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 471, p. 112064. , page IOP Publishing; (2020) Perícia criminal, , http://apcf.org.br/pericia-criminal/pericia-criminal, APCF.

This study aims to design improvement of Indonesia’s E-Procurement system that can minimize corruption and improve efficiency in the procurement process by using Business Process Reengineering (BPR) and Structured System Development (SSD) methods. BPR is performed by modeling and simulating current (As-Is) and proposed (To-Be) process. SSD in this study consists of four stages; the creation of Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), relational tables, use case diagram, and Data Flow Diagram (DFD). This study provides three improvement scenarios to solve issues in the E-procurement system by implementing an integrated information system linkage across government agencies and a real-time bidding solution. The three scenario models' simulation has different solutions to minimize corruption and produce different cycle times for each scenario. Using the SSD method, the information system model is designed to support business process improvement with the best scenario. © IEOM Society International.";"Business Process Reengineering; Corruption; E-Procurement; Information System; Structured System Development";;"Ashworth, C., Slater, L., (1993) An Introduction to SSADM, , McGraw-Hill/Irwin; Assessment, S., (2007) of Indonesia ’ S Public Procurement System Piloting OECD / DAC Procurement JV Baseline Indicator ( BLI ) Benchmarking Methodology, , Benchmarking; Becker, P.

Creating a quality model as a foundation to perform a quality analysis largely depends on the quality and volume of data that is analyzed. It is important to find a way to identify anomalies before they occur and to prevent any kind of harm that is of public interest. For this reason, we focused our research on an early phase of the PPP, the preparation of the tender documentation. During this phase, it is important to collect documents, detect and extract quality content from it, and analyze this content for any possible manipulation of the PPP’s outcome. Part of the documentation related to defining the rules and restrictions for the PPP is usually within a specific section of the documents, often called “technical and professional ability.” In previous studies, the authors extracted and processed these sections and used extracted content in order to develop a prediction model for indicating fraudulent activities. As the criteria and conditions can also be found in other parts of the PPP’s documentation, the idea of this research is to detect additional content and to investigate its impact on the outcome of the prediction model. Therefore, our goal was to determine a list of relevant terms and to develop a data science model finding and extracting terms in order to improve the predictions of suspicious tender. An evaluation was conducted based on an initial prediction model trained with the extracted content as additional input parameters. The training results show a significant improvement in the output metrics. This study presents a methodology for detecting the content needed to predict suspicious procurement procedures, for measuring the relevance of extracted terms, and for storing the most important information in a relational structure in a database.

In this study, we analyzed differentness kinds of corruption like (bribery, collusion embezzlement, misappropriation, fraud, abuse of discretion, favoritism, nepotism), and six types of Artificial Intelligence techniques (classification, regression, clustering, prediction, outlier detection, and visualization). The methodology proposed by Torres-Carrion was used, and four research questions were raised, which allow knowing the types of research carried out, the characteristics of the organizations in which the investigations are carried out, the technological tools, and data mining methodologies and techniques. The search was done in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, getting 102 articles published between 2015 and 2019. The primary data mining techniques used are logistic models, neural networks, Bayesian networks, supported vector machines, and decision trees. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;"Artificial Intelligence; Corruption; Data mining; Procurement; Systematic literature review";"Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Crime; Decision trees; Trees (mathematics); Artificial intelligence techniques; Corruption; Procurement; Public procurement; Research questions; Supported vector machines; Systematic literature review; Technological tools; Data mining";"Báez Gómez, J.E., Relación entre el Índice de Control de la Corrupción y algunas variables sociales, económicas e institucionales (2013) Nómadas.

This large (N = 1,874), retrospective study examined rates of SAK submissions by law enforcement to the state crime laboratory for analysis from 2010 to 2013 at four sites in a Western state in the United States with established sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) programs. Variables of legal and extralegal characteristics in sexual assault cases were explored through generalized estimating equations (GEE) modeling to determine what factors statistically predicted SAK submissions. For submitted SAKs, the length of time between the dates of assault and dates of submission was categorized, and bivariate and multivariate analyses were calculated to discover legal and extralegal characteristics affecting time of submission. The study sites represented 40% of the state’s law enforcement agencies and 65% of the state’s population. Out of the 1,874 SAKs in the study, only 38.2% were submitted by law enforcement to the state crime laboratory for analysis. When SAK submissions were examined based on time between assaults and submission dates, 22.8% were submitted within a year of the assault and 15.4% were submitted more than a year after the assault following media and community pressure for law enforcement agencies to submit SAKs in storage. Significant variability of SAK submission rates and the time submitted from the assault dates were found between the sites. Site location was found to be the main determinant of whether or not SAKs were submitted. The lack of SAK submissions for analysis results in justice denied for victims and raises public safety concerns.

This article uses machine learning tools to analyze a large dataset of public contracts from across Europe, in order to identify the conditions under which close connections, defined both in terms of repeated interaction, as well as geographical dispersion, appear. Previous theoretical results suggest that close ties should emerge as an enforcement mechanism in settings characterized by weak outside enforcement, such as those involving corruption. Results from random forest models show support for this hypothesis, along with identifying other structural determinants of the outcome. The most striking finding is that even after accounting for numerous potential confounders, major differences in terms of average diversity levels between countries persist, and these differences map onto an indicator of governance quality and corruption, but not at all on income per capita. These findings point to the centrality of the structure of interactions between private and public actors for understanding governance outcomes. Copyright © V.K.

It embraces the active involvement of multiple stakeholders. Intricacies of procurement process, close interactions among public officials, businesses, and a multitude of stakeholders make procurement process analysis and modeling a complex exercise. Bearing this in mind, the present research aims to identify risks in public procurement and uncover the potential contributors and their interrelationships. The proposed methodology integrates grounded theory with fault tree and failure mode effects and criticality analysis techniques. The results identify several corruption risk factors and rank them according to their criticality. Interestingly, 45 combinations of risk elements were identified that may lead to unfair contract award. It also deduces important practical insights for strengthening organizational corruption controls and improving procurement processes. Further, this model contributes in opening up future research avenues for conducting improved risk assessment. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;"corruption; government contracting; internal controls";;"Aldrich, H.E., (1999) Organizations evolving, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Amemba, C.S., Nyaboke, P.G., Osoro, A., Mburu, N., Challenges Affecting Public Procurement Performance Process in Kenya (2015) IEJBM, 7 (7), pp. 271-280; Andersson, S., Erlingsson, New management and risks of corruption: The case of Sweden (2012) The social construction of corruption in Europe, pp. 33-57. , A.

SkelNetOn aims to bring together researchers from different domains to foster learning methods on global shape understanding tasks. We aim to improve and evaluate the state-of-the-art shape understanding approaches, and to serve as reference benchmarks for future research. Similar to other challenges in computer vision, SkelNetOn proposes three datasets and corresponding evaluation methodologies; all coherently bundled in three competitions with a dedicated workshop co-located with CVPR 2019 conference.

Since it almost always focuses on the prediction of corrupt competition, the calculation of various indices and indications of corruption to the data itself are very difficult to come by. These data sets usually have very few observations, especially accurately labelled ones. The prevention or detection of compromised public procurement processes is definitely a crucial step, related to the initial phase of public procurement, i.e., the phase of publication of the notice. The aim of this paper is to compare prediction models using text-mining techniques and machine-learning methods to detect suspicious tenders, and to develop a model to detect suspicious one-bid tenders. Consequently, we have analyzed tender documentation for particular tenders, extracted the content of interest about the levels of all bids and grouped it by procurement lots using machine-learning methods. A model that includes the aforementioned components uses the most common text classification algorithms for the purpose of prediction: naive Bayes, logistic regression and support vector machines. The results of the research showed that knowledge in the tender documentation can be used for detection suspicious tenders. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Starting from a contextualization about the meaning and impact of big data and the technology of data analytics in the public sector, six experiences are presented conducted by the Comptroller General's Office (CGU), the main audit body of the Brazilian government, of data mining and predictive analytics used to prevent risks, irregularities and fraud in public procurement and contracts. In general, these initiatives allowed an optimization of the human and organizational resources involved in the audit activity, prioritizing situations in which potential irregularities were, detected. The article also emphasizes that, despite the legitimate purpose of administrative efficiency, the practice of data mining, using big data, must be compatible with the principles of due process of law, public transparency and the protection of the fundamental rights. of citizens, especially the protection of their personal data. © 2019, Revista General de Derecho Administrativo.

Sanga S.;"35335069800;";A new strategy for regulating arbitration;2019;Northwestern University Law Review;113;5;;1121;1162;;4;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067574166&partnerID=40&md5=87704e3d4259d8fb4c72ae9372926952;"Confidential arbitration is a standard precondition to employment. But confidential arbitration prevents a state from ensuring or even knowing whether employees’ economic, civil, and due process rights are respected. Further, employers regularly require employees to waive rights to class proceedings (thereby foreclosing small claims) and to arbitrate under the laws of another jurisdiction (thereby evading mandatory state law). In response, states have tried to regulate arbitration provisions, arbitral awards, and arbitral processes. But these efforts have all failed because the Supreme Court says they are preempted by the Federal Arbitration Act. In this Article, I argue that states can and should adopt a new strategy: Deter parties from forming such contracts in the first place. The Article proceeds in three parts. First, I explain the problem. Over the last fifty years, the Supreme Court systematically immunized arbitration provisions against every plausible contract defense. Yet the Supreme Court continues to insist that, just as the Federal Arbitration Act requires, arbitration agreements are still subject to “generally applicable contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability.”1 This is false. Second, I present the first large-scale evidence on the pervasiveness of arbitration. The Supreme Court’s arbitration precedents have effect only to the extent private parties agree to arbitrate their disputes. To study this, I use machine-learning protocols to parse millions of filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and create a database of nearly 800,000 contracts formed by public companies. These contracts include employment agreements, credit agreements, joint ventures, purchases, and others. Employment contracts are by far the most likely to include a mandatory arbitration provision. Finally, I argue that, because the Supreme Court has all but stripped states of their power to enforce contracts, states should adopt policies that deter formation of objectionable contracts. For example, states cannot prohibit forced arbitration of sexual harassment claims. They can, however, prohibit sexual harassment as a subject matter for employment contracts;they can also enforce this with civil penalties and whistleblower rewards. Similarly, states cannot stop an employer from arbitrating under the laws of another jurisdiction, thereby evading mandatory limits on noncompete agreements. But states can declare noncompetes illegal, levy civil fines on employers that form them, and again offer employees whistleblower rewards to report violations. These approaches work because they create a cause of action for a third party-the state-who is not subject to the arbitration agreement. And unlike past efforts, these laws would not be preempted because they do not “derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.”2. © 2019 by Sarath Sanga.";;;"Sanga, S., Choice of Law: An Empirical Analysis (2014) J.

For this reason, the detection of anomalies in public procurements can improve the quality of purchases, and consequently enable a better quality of life in the country through the correct use of public funds. In this paper, we use as a case study the public contracts of Paraguay, which are in the open data format of the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS), for training an unsupervised learning model for anomaly detection, based on the Isolation Forest algorithm. The resulting classification allows to obtain a measurement or scoring of contracts that can be used to identify outliers. Given a local dataset of cases of procurement processes with protests with judgments in favor of the protestant or with citizen complaints, the preliminary results show that the trained model classifies as anomalous more than 45% of the potentially anomalous dataset. A detailed validation considering the public procurements local regulations is needed, with the purpose of building a tool that allows an intelligent sampling of contracts with atypical behavior to review, applicable to Paraguay and other countries that implement the OCDS. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

The main contribution of the project is the development of a data science-based solution to systematically assist managing authorities to increase the effectiveness and efficiency when analysing fraud and corruption cases. The tool combines descriptive and predictive machine learning models with advanced statistics and visualisations. In this regard, we define a number of specific requirements in terms of questions and data analyses, as well as risk indicators and other anomaly patterns. Each of these requirements will materialize in specific visualisations, reports and dashboards included in the final solution. Several internal and external data sources are analysed and assessed to explore possible irregularities in budget and cash management, public service accounts, salaries, disbursement, grants, subsidies, etc. The project has already resulted in an initial prototype (SALER Analytics) successfully tested by the governing bodies of Valencia, in Spain. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;"Corruption; Data science; Public procurement";"Budget control; Compensation (personnel); Crime; Data mining; Data Science; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Visualization; Anomaly patterns; Cash Management; Corruption; Effectiveness and efficiencies; External data sources; Governing bodies; Machine learning models; Public procurement; Public administration";"Bertot, J.C., Jaeger, P.T., Grimes, J.M., Using ICTs to create a culture of transparency: E-government and social media as openness and anti-corruption tools for societies (2010) Gov.

Research also suggests law enforcement officers use tobacco (which is not healthy at any rate) and alcohol at rates exceeding those of other populations. Although several studies have documented the above across a wide variety of law enforcement populations, research has not previously explored the extent to which state police officers use tobacco and alcohol. Because no studies explore state law enforcement officer use of tobacco and alcohol, no studies exist that identify factors predictive of state police officer use of alcohol and tobacco. This study addresses these gaps in the literature by surveying all sworn state police officers of one state police agency. Policy recommendations, as they pertain to reducing state police officer use of alcohol and tobacco are discussed below. © The Author(s) 2018.;"alcohol; criminal justice policy; Law enforcement officer health and wellness; state police; tobacco";;"Avdija, A., Stress and law enforcers: testing the relationship between law enforcement work stressors and health-related issues (2014) Health Psychology and Behavioral Medicine, 2 (1), pp. 100-110; Ballenger, J.F., Best, S.R., Metzler, T.J., Wasserman, D.A., Mohr, D.C., Liberman, A., Delucchi, K., Marmar, C.R., Patterns and predictors of alcohol use in male and female urban police officers (2011) American Journal on Addiction, 20 (1), pp. 21-29; Bates, C., Fagerström, K., Jarvis, M.J., Kunze, M., McNeill, A., Ramström, L., European Union policy on smokeless tobacco: a statement in favour of evidence based regulation for public health (2003) Tobacco Control, 12 (4), pp. 360-367; Bernard, P., Ninot, G., Moullec, G., Guillaume, S., Courtet, P., Quantin, X., Smoking cessation, depression, and exercise: empirical evidence, clinical needs, and mechanisms (2013) Nicotine & Tobacco Research, 15 (10), pp. 1635-1650; Black, D.W., Zimmerman, M., Coryell, W.H., Cigarette smoking and psychiatric disorder in a community sample (1999) Annals of Clinical Psychology, 11, pp. 129-136; Blair, J.M., Fowler, K.A., Betz, C.J., Baumgardner, J.L., Occupational homicides of law enforcement officers, 2003–2013: data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (2016) American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 51 (3), pp. S188-S196; Boyce, R.W., Perko, M.A., Jones, G.R., Hiatt, A.H., Boone, E.L., Physical fitness, absenteeism and workers’ compensation in smoking and non-smoking police officers (2006) Occupational Medicine, 56, pp. 353-356; (2015) Links between Officer Trauma and Substance Abuse, , https://www.hazeldenbettyford.org/education/bcr/addiction-research/alcohol-abuse-police-ru-716; Cantor, C.H., Tyman, R., Slater, P.J., A historical survey of police suicide in Queensland, Australia, 1843–1992 (1995) Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, 25, pp. 499-507; (2016) Current Cigarette Smoking among Adults in the United States, , https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/, accessed 08 June 2018; Chae, M.H., Boyle, D.J., Police suicide: prevalence, risk, and protective factors (2013) Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies & Management, 36 (1), pp. 91-118; Charles, L.E., Burchfiel, C.M., Fekedulegn, D., Vila, B., Hartley, T.A., Slaven, J., Mnatsakanova, A., Violanti, J.M., Shift work and sleep: the Buffalo police health study (2007) Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies & Management, 30 (2), pp. 215-227; Chopko, B.A., Palmieri, P.A., Adams, R.E., Associations between police stress and alcohol use: Implications for practice (2013) Journal of Loss and Trauma: International Perspectives on Stress & Coping, 18 (5), pp. 482-497; Christen, A.G., The clinical effects of tobacco on oral tissue (1970) The Journal of the American Dental Association, 81 (6), pp. 1378-1382; Cross, C.L., Aschley, L., Police trauma and addiction: Coping with the dangers of the job (2004) FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, , 10; Cummings, K.M., Brown, A., O’Connor, R., The cigarette controversy (2007) Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, 16 (6), pp. 1070-1076; Dom, H.F., The relationship of cancer of the lung and the use of tobacco (1954) The American Statistician, 8 (5), pp. 7-13; Franke, W.D., Collins, S.A., Hinz, P.N., Cardiovascular disease morbidity in an Iowa law enforcement cohort, compared with the general Iowa population (1998) Journal of Occupational & Environmental Medicine, 40 (5), pp. 441-444; Fyfe, N.R., Complex transition and uncertain trajectories: reflections on recent developments in police professionalism (2013) Journal of Workplace Learning, 26 (6), pp. 407-420; Ganesh, K.S., Naresh, A.G.V., Bammigatti, C., Prevalence and risk factors of hypertension among male police personnel in urban Puducherry, India (2014) Kathmandu University Medical Journal, (4), pp. 242-246. , 48; Gershon, R.R.M., Lin, S., Li, X., Work stress in aging police officers (2002) Journal of Occupational & Environmental Medicine, 44 (2), pp. 160-167; Harris, K.R., Eccles, D.W., Freeman, C., Ward, P., ‘Gun!

E-procurement has been used in governance in many countries as a means of increasing transparency, efficiency and reduction of corruption within the government. The Indonesia's Government became one of country that use e-procurement in the procurement of goods nor services. Many studies on e-procurement in the government sector have been conducted, but very few researches that focuses on its impact on good governance. This study conducted to do investigation of success rate of implementation of e-procurement in terms of some of the factors of good governance in the Indonesian government. Questionnaires were distributed to supplier who provide goods and/or services listed in the system. Data was analyzed by Structural Equation Model using Partial Least Square method. The results showed that Indonesian government uses of SPSE resulted increased transparency in procurement of goods and services. © 2017 IEEE.;"e-procurement; good governance; public procurement";"Information management; Surveys; Transparency; e-Procurement; Good governances; Government sectors; Indonesia; Indonesians; Partial least square methods; Public procurement; Structural equation modeling; Least squares approximations";"Agus, A., Barker, S., Kandampully, J., An exploratory study of service quality in the Malaysian public service sector (2007) International Journal of Quality & Reliability Management, 24 (2), pp. 177-190; Aman, A., Kasimin, H., E-procurement implementation: A case of Malaysia government (2011) Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy, pp. 330-344; Arjun, N., Jeffrey, S., Kishor, V., Jianming, Y., Willingness to adopt e-procurement to reduce corruption (2014) Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy, pp. 500-520; Bayazit, O., Investigating adoption of E-procurement systems: An empirical study (2014) International Journal of Information Systems and Supply Chain Management, 7 (2), pp. 41-66; Bertot, J., Jaeger, P., Grimes, J., Using ICTs to create a culture of transparency: E-government and social media as openness and anti-corruption tools for societies (2010) Government Information Quarterly, 27 (3), pp. 264-271; Bof, F., Previtali, P., National models of public (e)- procurement in Europe (2010) Journal of E-Government Studies and Best Practices, 2010 (14); Brandon-Jones, A., Carey, S., The impact of user-perceived eprocurement quality on system and contract compliance (2011) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 31 (3), pp. 274-296; Chang, H.-L., Wang, K., Chiu, I., Business-IT fit in eprocurement systems: Evidence from high-technology firms in China (2008) Information Systems Journal, 18 (4), pp. 381-404; Chang, Y., Markatsoris, H., Richards, H., Design and implementation of an e-procurement system (2004) Production Planning & Control: The Management of Operations, 15 (7), pp. 634-646; Croom, S.R., The impact of web-based procurement on the management of operating resources supply (2000) Journal of Supply Chain Management, 36 (4), pp. 4-13; Croom, S., Brandon-Jones, A., Impact of e-procurement: Experiences from implementation in the UK public sector (2007) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 13 (4), pp. 294-303; Davila, A., Gupta, M., Palmer, R., Moving procurement systems to the internet: The adoption and use of E-procurement technology models (2003) European Management Journal, 21 (1), pp. 11-23; Gardenal, F., A model to measure e-procurement impacts on organizational performance (2013) Journal of Public Procurement, 13 (2), pp. 215-242; Ghozali, I., (2006) Structural Equation Modeling Metode Alternatif Dengan Partial Least Squares (PLS), , Semarang: Badan Penerbit Universitas Diponegoro; Graham, J., Amos, B., Plumpltre, T., Principles for good governance in the 21st century (2003) Policy Brief, 15, pp. 1-6. , (2003); Hui, W., Othman, R., Omar, N., Rahman, R., Haron, N., Procurement issues in Malaysia (2011) International Journal of Public Sector Management, 24 (6), pp. 567-593; Kassim, E.S., Hussin, H., A success model for the Malaysian government e-procurement system: The buyer perspective (2013) International Journal of Electronic Government Research, pp. 1-18; Kim, S., Kim, H., Lee, H., An institutional analysis of an egovernment system for anti-corruption: The case of OPEN (2009) Government Information Quarterly, 26 (1), pp. 42-50; Losch, A., Lambert, J.S., E-reverse auctions revisited: An analysis of context, buyer-supplier relations and information behavior (2007) Journal of Supply Chain Management, 43 (4), pp. 47-63; (2016), https://eproc.lkpp.go.id/content/tentang, LPSE LKPP.

The basic idea is to assemble multiple residual neural networks (ResNets), in which the training data has been pretreated with different methods. For different situations with practical applications, we put forward two training methods. Our method performs better than a single ResNet or a simple ensemble of ResNets. The validity of the framework is verified on two data sets: dermoscopic images and skin surface photos. For dermoscopic images, we completed the third part of a public competition, called “ISIC 2017: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection”. The metric is the mean value of the area under the curve (AUC) for the melanoma and seborrheic keratosis classifications. Our framework achieves a result of 0.917 on the test set, which is 0.046 higher than a single ResNet. For skin surface photos, we collected images of four diseases, including eczema, heatrash, subitum, and varicella. The framework achieves 82.4% accuracy on the test set, which is 3% higher than the baseline. This implies that the proposed framework is applicable in practice and achieves excellent performance. © 2018;"Deep convolutional neural network; Medical image classification; Model ensemble; Multi-Channel-ResNet; Skin diseases";;"Jana, G.K., Gupta, A., Das, A., Tripathy, R., Sahoo, P., Herbal treatment to skin diseases: a global approach (2010) Drug Invent Today, 2 (8); Cascinelli, N., Ferrario, M., Tonelli, T., Leo, E., A possible new tool for clinical diagnosis of melanoma: the computer (1987) J Am Acad Dermatol, 16 (2), pp. 361-367; Umbaugh, S.E., Computer vision in medicine: color metrics and image segmentation methods for skin cancer diagnosis (1990); Stanganelli, I., Brucale, A., Calori, L., Gori, R., Lovato, A., Magi, S., Kopf, B., Testori, A., Computer-aided diagnosis of melanocytic lesions (2005) Anticancer Res, 25 (6C), pp. 4577-4582; Masood, A., Al-Jumaily, A.A., Computer aided diagnostic support system for skin cancer: a review of techniques and algorithms (2013) Int J Biomed Imag, 2013; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 1097-1105; Simonyan, K., Zisserman, A., Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition (2014), arXiv preprint; Abdel-Hamid, O., Mohamed, A.-R., Jiang, H., Deng, L., Penn, G., Yu, D., Convolutional neural networks for speech recognition (2014) IEEE/ACM Transactions on audio, speech, and language processing, 22 (10), pp. 1533-1545; Esteva, A., Kuprel, B., Novoa, R.A., Ko, J., Swetter, S.M., Blau, H.M., Thrun, S., Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks (2017) Nature, 542 (7639), p. 115; Codella, N., Cai, J., Abedini, M., Garnavi, R., Halpern, A., Smith, J.R., Deep learning, sparse coding, and svm for melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images (2015) International workshop on machine learning in medical imaging, pp. 118-126. , Springer; Codella, N.C., Nguyen, Q.-B., Pankanti, S., Gutman, D.A., Helba, B., Halpern, A.C., Smith, J.R., Deep learning ensembles for melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images (2017) IBM J Res Dev, 61 (4). , 5–1; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Deep residual learning for image recognition (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 770-778; Pan, S.J., Yang, Q., A survey on transfer learning (2010) IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng, 22 (10), pp. 1345-1359; J New Engl.

One very successful developer of an e-procurement system is the Public Procurement Policy Institution, or Lembaga Kebijakan Pengadaan Barang/Jasa Pemerintah (LKPP), with 731 government agencies and 333,452 suppliers accessing LKPP's system. This study was conducted to analyse the determinants of an e-procurement system's success as well as its impact on perceived transparency from the supplier's perspective. This study answers both questions by applying a covariance-based structural equation modelling approach to analyse the survey data of 157 respondents. This study finds that only system quality, service quality, regulation, trust, user satisfaction, and perceived benefits determine an e-procurement system's success. However, only trust in an e-procurement system predominantly affects perceived transparency. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.;"DeLone and McLean; E-government; E-procurement; Indonesia; Information system success; Lembaga Kebijakan Pengadaan Barang/Jasa Pemerintah; LKPP; Perceived transparency; Structural equation modelling; Trust";;"Abu-Shanab, E., Al-Azzam, A., Trust dimensions and the adoption of e-government in Jordan (2012) International Journal of Information Communication Technologies and Human Development, 4 (1), pp. 39-51; Agarwal, R., Prasad, J., Are individual differences germane to the acceptance of new information technologies?

One unique response to these challenges is the formation of a hybrid digital forensic task force: a formal partnership between higher educational institutions and municipal and/or state law enforcement agencies to further education, research, and investigatory capacity in the digital forensic field. To better understand this organizational model, this study conducted a comparative analysis between eight such task forces in the United States using the theoretical guidance of neo-institutional theory, the first such national assessment. The findings indicated that there was not one “common” model between the task forces – the number of examiners ranged from 1 to 7 or more, the average number of years the task forces were operational was 7, and the academic components varied. Despite model variation, task forces reported that the benefits related to the integration of academia with law enforcement agencies enhanced their capabilities to better serve their communities and provide a greater benefit to society. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;"Academia; Digital forensics; Institutional theory; Law enforcement; Organizations";"Computer crime; Education; Electronic crime countermeasures; Law enforcement; Societies and institutions; Academia; Educational institutions; Forensic investigation; Institutional contexts; Institutional theory; Law-enforcement agencies; Neo-institutional theories; Organizational modeling; Digital forensics";"Ali, S.S., Police Shortage Hits Small Towns across the Country (2017), http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-shortage-hits-cities-small-towns-across-country-n734721, NBC News (Accessed 11 June 2017); Forensic Accreditation (2017), http://www.anab.org/forensic-accreditation, (Accessed 25 June 2017); Aten, K., Howard-Grenville, J., Encouraging trade at the boundary of organizational culture and institutional theory (2012) J.

""Possession"" laws prohibit the possession of firearms by these offenders. ""Relinquishment"" laws prohibit firearm possession and also explicitly require offenders to surrender their firearms. Few studies have assessed the effect of these policies. Objective: To study the association between state IPV-related firearm laws and IPH rates over a 25-year period (1991 to 2015). Design: Panel study. Setting: United States, 1991 to 2015. Participants: Homicides committed by intimate partners, as identified in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports, Supplementary Homicide Reports. Measurements: IPV-related firearm laws (predictor) and annual, state-specific, total, and firearm-related IPH rates (outcome). Results: State laws that prohibit persons subject to IPV-related restraining orders from possessing firearms and also require them to relinquish firearms in their possession were associated with 9.7% lower total IPH rates (95% CI, 3.4% to 15.5% reduction) and 14.0% lower firearm-related IPH rates (CI, 5.1% to 22.0% reduction) than in states without these laws. Laws that did not explicitly require relinquishment of firearms were associated with a non-statistically significant 6.6% reduction in IPH rates. Limitations: The model did not control for variation in implementation of the laws. Causal interpretation is limited by the observational and ecological nature of the analysis. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that state laws restricting firearm possession by persons deemed to be at risk for perpetrating intimate partner abuse may save lives. Laws requiring at-risk persons to surrender firearms already in their possession were associated with lower IPH rates.

Public procurement has a huge potential to stimulate the economy by providing opportunities to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME's), if done correctly. The major bottleneck in the current procurement process is inefficient tendering and selection of bids. Tanzania still doesn't have a fully operational e-procurement platform. This paper analyses how Innovation can be used in Public Procurement to ensure true fairness, competitiveness, transparency and value for money in public projects. Technology is a powerful tool to influence business culture. This paper describes the overall Procurement Management practices used in Tanzania, the challenges, how the procurement process affects public projects (i.e. Time and Cost), how e-evaluation as a component of e-procurement can reduce Time and Cost of Public Projects and Finally the Project Plan and scope for the implementation of an efficient e-tendering system. © 2017 IEEE.;"E-evaluation; E-procurement; E-tendering; Innovation; Public Procurement; Public Projects; Tanzania";"Artificial intelligence; Costs; Innovation; e-Evaluation; e-Procurement; E-tendering; Public procurement; Public project; Tanzania; Software engineering";"Kayed, A., Colomb, R., (2002) Book Chapter: B2B Electronic Commerce: The Electronic Tendering in Business to Business Electronic Commerce, , Challenges & Solutions, Idea Group Publishing Hershey, USA; Kerridge, S., Halaris, C., Mentzas, G., Kerridge, S., Virtual tendering and bidding in the construction sector (2000) Proceedings of EC-Web 2000, pp. 379-388. , Springer; Lai, S.C., (2007) E-Tendering with Web Services: A Case Study on the Tendering Process of Building Construction, pp. 582-588. , July, 9-13; Abdullah, A., (2008) Noor: Web-based Prequalification for Tender Management System, 2, pp. 1-6. , June 30 2008-July; (2014) Public Procurement Act, (3). , Government of Tanzania. of; Mamiro, R.G., (2015) Value for Money, the Limping Pillar in Public Procurement-Experience from Tanzania, , Institute of Accountancy, Arusha; Fjeldstad, O.H., Fighting fiscal corruption: Lessons from the Tanzania Revenue Authority (2012) Public Administration and Development, 23 (2), pp. 165-175";Conference Paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85030870749

Therefore, the enterprise architecture (EA) models should satisfy the regional and national requirements, and business strategies. Assuming that business structure and processes follow business strategy, the main goals of the paper are to present the business strategy model in the enterprise architecture language, i.e., ArchiMate and to emphasize the strategy formulation value for the business process modeling. © ISD 2017.;"ArchiMate; Business analytics; Business architecture; Business strategy; Process modeling; Public procurement";"Information systems; Information use; Management information systems; Modeling languages; Strategic planning; Archimate; Business process model; Business strategy; Business structures; Enterprise Architecture; Local policies; Public procurement; Strategy formulations; Information management";"Ahlemann, F., Legner, Ch, Schafczuk, D., The need for enterprise architecture management (EAM) (2012) Strategic Enterprise Architecture Management, Challenges, Best Practices and Future Developments, pp. 5-13. , Ahlemann, F., Stettiner, E., Messerschmidt, M., Legner, Ch.

A probabilistic ontology provides constructs for representing uncertainty in domain ontologies. While the literature has been growing on formalisms for representing uncertainty in ontologies, there remains little guidance in the knowledge engineering literature for how to design probabilistic ontologies. To address the gap, this paper presents the Uncertainty Modeling Process for Semantic Technology (UMP-ST), a new methodology for modeling probabilistic ontologies. To explain how the methodology works and to verify that it can be applied to different scenarios, this paper describes step-by-step the construction of a proof-of-concept probabilistic ontology. The resulting domain model can be used to support identification of fraud in public procurements in Brazil. While the case study illustrates the development of a probabilistic ontology in the PR-OWL probabilistic ontology language, the methodology is applicable to any ontology formalism that properly integrates uncertainty with domain semantics. © 2016 Carvalho et al.;"Bayesian networks; MEBN; Methodology; Modeling; PR-OWL; Semantic technology; Semantic web; UMP-ST; Uncertainty; UP";"Bayesian networks; Birds; Knowledge based systems; Models; Ontology; Semantic Web; MEBN; Methodology; Semantic technologies; UMP-ST; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis";"Adelman, L., (1992) Evaluating decision support and expert systems, , 1st edition.

Complete contracts entail state-contingent clauses that compensate the contractor for shocks unrelated to his own effort. By improving insurance, those contracts reduce the agency cost of moral hazard. When the contractor has private information on revenues shocks, verifying messages on shocks realizations is costly. Incomplete contracts do not specify state-contingent clauses, thereby saving on verifiability costs. This makes incomplete contracts attractive even though they entail greater agency costs. Because of private information on contracting costs, a public official may have discretion to choose whether to procure under a complete or an incomplete contract. When the public official is corrupt, such delegation results in incomplete contracts being chosen too often. Empirical predictions on the use of incomplete contracts and policy implications on the benefits of standardized contracts are discussed. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.;"Corruption; Incomplete contracts; Moral hazard; Principalagentsupervisor model; Publicprivate partnerships; Risk allocation";"Contractors; Costs; Crime; Economics; Public policy; Risk management; Corruption; Incomplete contracts; Moral hazard; Public private partnerships; Risk allocation; Contracts";"Aghion, P., Hermalin, B., Legal restrictions on private contracts can enhance efficiency (1990) J.

Second, these firms enjoy extra returns, so that procurement related activities attract the best entrepreneurs.

Methods: The authors carefully reviewed and analyzed statutes, regulations, adivsory opinions, case law, court documents, articles from legal journals, and news articles. Results: Certain facts-driven UDT arrangements tend to violate federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including Stark law, the anti-kickback statute, the criminal health care fraud statute, and the False Claims Act. Conclusions: Healthcare practitioners who use UDT can help ensure that they are in compliance with applicable federal and state laws by evaluating whether their actions are motivated by providing proper care to their patients rather than by profits. They must avoid schemes that violate the spirit of the law while appearing to comply with the letter of the law. Such a simple self-evaluation of motive can reduce a practitioner's likelihood of civil fines and criminal liability. © 2015 Journal of Opioid Management, All Rights Reserved.;"Anti-kickback statute; Best practices; Criminal healthcare fraud statute; False Claims Act; Healthcare fraud; Laboratories; Stark law; Urine drug testing";"controlled substance; narcotic analgesic agent; prescription drug; biological marker; addiction; chronic pain; clinical trial (topic); criminal law; drug abuse; fraud; health care personnel; human; laboratory test; law; legal aspect; medical literature; physician self-referral; profit; Review; self evaluation; urine drug testing; attitude to health; commercial phenomena; conflict of interest; health personnel attitude; legislation and jurisprudence; motivation; physician attitude; predictive value; prevention and control; procedures; reproducibility; substance abuse; Substance-Related Disorders; urinalysis; urine; Attitude of Health Personnel; Biological Markers; Commerce; Conflict of Interest; Fraud; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Motivation; Physician's Role; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Substance Abuse Detection; Substance-Related Disorders; Urinalysis";"Results from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Summary of National Findings, , http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/defaidt/files/NSDUHresultsPDFWHTML2013/Web/NSDUHresults2013.pdf, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Accessed January 1, 2015; http://books.nap.edu/open-book.php?record-id=13172&page=l, Institute of Medicine Report from the Committee on Advancing Pain Research, Care and Education, Relieving Pain in America, a Blueprint for Transforming Prevention, Care, Education and Research, Accessed January 5, 2015; Barnes, M.C., Barthwell, A.G., Marson, J., National Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Strategy, , http://claad.org/ivp-content/uploads/2013/10/2010-National-Strategy.pdf, Accessed January 5, 2015; Heit, H.A., Gourlay, D.L., Urine drug testing in pain medicine (2004) J Pain Symptom Manage., 27 (3), pp. 260-267; Owen, G.T., Burton, A.W., Schade, C.M., Urine drug testing: Current recommendations and best practices (2012) Pain Physician., 15 (3), pp. ES119-ES133; Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Addiction in Opioid Treatment Programs: TIP 43, , http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64l64/pdf/TOC.pdf, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

The authors have identified anti-corruption attributes through an extensive literature review and developed a theoretical model representing the impact of four latent variables, monopoly of power, information asymmetry, trust and transparency and accountability on the dependent variable, the intent-to-adopt e-procurement (ITA).Design/methodology/approach – Data for this research were obtained by the use of a questionnaire survey of bidders who were officially registered with the Government of Nepal. As part of the fieldwork for this research, the first author collected the perceptions of 220 bidders regarding the potential of public e-procurement to reduce corruption in public procurement processes.Findings – The findings suggest that a high level of the ITA has a positive and significant relationship with the independent variables that might inform the developed and emerging countries to make a decision to adoption of e-procurement to combat corruption in public procurement.Research limitations/implications – This study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration. The evaluation of anti-corruption factors, as they affect the willingness of users to adopt e-procurement on the bidder’s perception research model is relatively new to e-procurement research. A limitation of the research was that it gathered and analyzed data from a single country with a limited number of respondents. More research is needed to identify the anti-corruption factors of e-procurement in reducing corruption, and also need strong empirical test to valid the factors that influence the adoption of e-procurement.Originality/value – This study aimed to contribute to the academic scholar, government agencies and public procurement practitioner in enhancing their understanding of the perceived anti-corruption factors of public e-procurement to reduce corruption. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;"Bidders; Corruption; E-procurement; Public procurement";;"Abdi, H., Partial least squares regression (PLS-regression) (2003) Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods, pp. 792-795. , Lewis-Beck, M., Bryman, A. and Futing, T.

Here, the authors use email services as an example, and present an adaptive fusion algorithm for spam detection (AFSD), which is a general, content-based approach and can be applied to nonemail spam detection tasks with little additional effort. The proposed algorithm uses n-grams of nontokenized text strings to represent an email, introduces a link function to convert the prediction scores of online learners to become more comparable, trains the online learners in a mistake-driven manner via thick thresholding to obtain highly competitive online learners, and designs update rules to adaptively integrate the online learners to capture different aspects of spams. The prediction performance of AFSD is studied on five public competition datasets and on one industry dataset, with the algorithm achieving significantly better results than several state-of-the-art approaches, including the champion solutions of the corresponding competitions. © 2001-2011 IEEE.;"adaptive fusion; intelligent systems; spam detection";"Competition; Electronic mail; Intelligent systems; Adaptive fusion; Content-based approach; Critical component; Email services; Link functions; Prediction performance; Spam detection; State-of-the-art approach; Online systems";"Cormack, G.V., Email Spam filtering: A systematic review (2007) Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval, 1 (4), pp. 335-455; Zhu, Y., Discovering spammers in social networks (2012) Proc. 26th AAAI Conf.

The authors identified anticorruption capabilities of e-procurement through an extensive literature review and a theoretical model representing the impact of three latent variables: monopoly of power, information asymmetry, and transparency and accountability upon the dependent variable, the intent-to-adopt e-procurement. This research was guided by the Principal- Agent theory and collected the perceptions of 46 government officers of the potential of public e-procurement to reduce corruption in public procurement processes. Results were analysed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach.

Because corrupt practices mostly occur under wraps, the task of combating corruption becomes even more difficult. In the course of a review of the extant literature on the theme a number of independent constructs with the potential to develop anti-corruption strategies have been identified. A research model was developed on the basis of the hypothesis that anti-corruption strategies lead to corruption free performance in public construction projects. A questionnaire survey was administered and 105 responses were collected. 'Anti-corruption strategies' was defined as a second order construct composed of four latent constructs: leadership, rules and regulations, training and fear of punishment. The structural equation modelling (SEM) technique was used to test the hypothesized positive inter-relations between anti-corruption strategies and corruption free performance. The significance of the role of management leadership, rules and regulations, training, as well as fear of punishment is highlighted to help policy makers and construction institutions in understanding the role of various anti-corruption strategies in public construction projects so that they may contribute to this important endeavour in achieving the goal of promoting economy, efficiency, quality, fairness and transparency. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.;"Anti-corruption; corruption; India; public construction projects";"Anti-corruption; corruption; India; Policy makers; Public construction projects; Public procurement; Questionnaire surveys; Research models; Rules and regulations; Second-order constructs; Structural equation modelling; Construction industry; Crime; construction; corruption; development project; institutional framework; modeling; performance assessment; policy making; project management; public sector; questionnaire survey; research; India";"Amaratunga, D., Baldry, D., Sarshar, M., Performance evaluation in facilities management: using the balanced scorecard approach (2000) Proceedings from COBRA 2000 RICS (Construction and Building Research Conference), pp. 1-16. , Royal Navy College, University of Greenwich, UK; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice. a review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Ashforth, B.E., Anand, V., The normalization of corruption in organizations (2003) Research in Organizational Behavior, 25, pp. 1-52; (2006) Curbing corruption in public procurement in Asia and the Pacific Manila: Asian Development Bank, , http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Public-Procurement-Asia-Pacific/public-procurement.pdf, Asian Development Bank/OECD, available at (accessed 24 May 2008); Bass, B., (1990) Bass & Stogdill's Handbook of Leadership: Theory, Research, and Managerial Applications, , New York: Free Press; Bentler, P.M., Yuan, K.H., Structural equation modeling with small samples: test statistics (1999) Multivariate Behavioral Research, 34 (2), pp. 181-197; Byrne, B.M., (1998) Structural Equation Modelling with LISREL, PRELIS and SIMPLIS: Basic Concepts, Applications and programming, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Calhoun, C.H., Wolitzer, P., Ethics as a value added service (2001) The CPA Journal, 71 (1), pp. 71-73; Cavill, S., Sohail, M., (2007) Accountability Arrangement to Combat Corruption: Literature Review, , Loughborough, UK: WEDC; Charan, R., Ending the CEO succession crisis (2005) Harvard Business Review, 83 (2), pp. 4-13; Chinda, T., Mohammad, S., Structural equation model of construction safety culture (2008) Engineering Construction and Architectural Management, 15 (2), pp. 114-131; Dininio, P., Kpundeh, S.J., Leiken, R., (1998) USAID Handbook for Fighting Corruption, Center for Democracy and Governance, US Agency for International Development, , Washington, DC; Doig, A., Riley, S., Corruption and anti-corruption strategies: issues and case studies from developing countries (1998) Corruption and Integrity Improvement Initiatives in Developing Countries, pp. 45-62. , In: UNDP, editors New York: United Nation Development Program; Dunn, S.C., Seaker, R.F., Waller, M.A., Latent variables in business logistics research: scale development and validation (1994) Journal of Business Logistics, 15 (2), pp. 145-172; Evans, J.M., Treviño, L.K., Weaver, G.R., Who's in the ethics driver's seat?

Caro C.A.;"55176712800;";Predicting State Police Officer Performance in the Field Training Officer Program: What Can We Learn from the Cadet's Performance in the Training Academy?;2011;American Journal of Criminal Justice;36;4;;357;370;;13;10.1007/s12103-011-9122-6;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80355144591&doi=10.1007%2fs12103-011-9122-6&partnerID=40&md5=0f527d46fdc5422ad32bf30ff836f00f;This paper examines the influence of the state police law enforcement academy on the performance of commissioned officers in the field training officer (FTO) program in a state in the Southeastern region of the United States. The police training academy is paramount in preparing cadets for the roles, responsibilities, and activities that graduates assume independently in the field. As such, it is important to understand the value added to future performance in the field through adequate preparation in the training academy. This study analyzes a sample of officers in the Southeastern region of the United States and explores the relationship between their performance as cadets in the academy and their performance as commissioned officers in the field training officer program. Through stepwise regression, the researcher concluded that the law enforcement training academy accounts for 10% of the performance variance of newly commissioned officers in the field officer training program. The researcher recommended further analysis of the law enforcement curriculum and of the field training officer program. This research should focus on the specific goals and objectives of the FTO program to ensure that the curriculum taught in the academy is properly aligned with the performance measures of the FTO program. © 2011 Southern Criminal Justice Association.;"Field officer training program; Law enforcement academy curriculum; Learning transfer; Performance prediction; State law enforcement; State police academy";;"(2010), http://www.asp.state.ar.us/, Arkansas State Police, Retrieved July 2010, from About Us; Ash, P., Slora, K., Britton, C., Police agency officer slection practices (1990) Journal of Police, 17, pp. 258-269; Aylward, J., Psychological testing and police selection (1985) Journal of Police Science and Administration, 13, pp. 201-210; Baldwin, T., Ford, J., Transfer of training: a review and directions for future research (1988) Personnel Psychology, 41, pp. 63-105; Bartol, C., Psychological characteristics of small town police officers (1982) Journal of Police Science and Administration, 10, pp. 58-63; Bartol, C., Predictive validation of the MPI for officers who fail (1991) Professional Psychology, Research and Practice, 22, pp. 127-132; Bernstein, I., Schoenfeld, L., Costello, R., Truncated component regression, multicollinearity, and the MMPI's use in a police officer selection setting (1982) Multivariate Behavioral Research, 17, pp. 99-116; Bradford, D., Pynes, J., Police academy training: why hasn't it kept up with practice?

In this report, the Korean BIT team presents the results from the survey conducted in Korea in 2006. The key results of the survey were as follows: • The most widely adopted technologies are websites/E-commerce, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), groupware/productivity tools; the least adopted technologies are biometrics, business intelligence, Enterprise Instant Messaging (IM), and business process modeling. • Workers need retraining constantly to keep up with changing technologies, and the proportion of employees facing a screen has increased significantly. However, neither teleconferencing nor telecommuting is widely used by the organizations. • The structure of the organization is changing due to technology. The monitoring of customer-facing interactions is the most significant trend, and the span of control for most managers is widening. Thus, automated monitoring of workforce productivity is increasing. • The most frequently outsourced business functions are IT programming and IT network management; the least outsourced business functions are RFP, Bids & contract management, finance, accounting, payroll, and order fulfillment. • Organizations favor using face-to-face, phone, and e-mail to contact customers over online intermediary and screen pops. • Organizations use customer profiling, statistical data mining, demand forecasting to integrate voices of customers, while text mining and fraud detection are not widely used. • Organizations use web banners, incentives in printed material, and pop-up windows for advertising. Only a small number of organizations have changed their logo, slogan, branding concept, and name to go online. • For CRM functions, a quarter of the organizations use order tracking/fulfillment, order placement, and customer complaints management, but sales calls automation and help desk are not widely used. • Online business shows lower sales volume, cost of products, pricing, and products/services than traditional business while higher data collection, revenue, and operating margins. • Small numbers of the organizations use Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), web-enabled communications, XML-based communications and E-procurement. • Direct purchasing, long-term purchasing contracts and catalogs are frequently used. Aggregators, buy side exchange/hub, exchange/E-exchange, sell side exchange/hub and OEM links/hubs are least used. • Due to technology, internal communication costs, market research costs, commercial costs, customer service costs, and production costs have decreased. However, new product's failure risks, technology costs, R&D costs, and revenues have increased. • Organizations have expanded and are planning to expand their business operations in South East (SE) Asia, East Asia, and the United States. Trade in other countries, the number of production/service bases and the number of countries in supplier base have increased. © 2010 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

Procurement is thus a multi-dimensional bidding contest with one-dimensional type space (the privately known cost). The optimal price and bribe bid is derived based on an iid private cost assumption. In the experiment, bribes are negatively framed to capture that society is better off if bribes are rare or low. Although bid prices are lower than predicted, behavior is qualitatively in line with the linear equilibrium prediction. When bribes generate a negative externality, there is a significant increase in the variability of the data.;"Corruption; Procurement auctions";;"Abbink, K., Rose-Ackerman, S., Laboratory experiments on corruption (2006) International Handbook on the Economics of Corruption, pp. 418-439. , Edward Elgar Cheltenham; Arozamena, L., Weinschelbaum, F., (2004) The Effect of Corruption on Bidding Behavior in First-price Auctions, , Discussion paper, Universidad de San Andrés; Beck, P.J., Maher, M.W., A comparison of bribery and bidding in thin markets (1986) Economics Letters, 20, pp. 1-5; Burguet, R., Che, Y.K., Competitive procurement with corruption (2004) Rand Journal of Economics, 35, pp. 50-68; Che, Y.K., Design competition through multidimensional auctions (1993) Rand Journal of Economics, 24, pp. 668-680; Compte, O., Lambert-Mogiliansky, A., Verdier, T., Corruption and competition in procurement (2005) Rand Journal of Economics, 36, pp. 1-15; Duggan, M., Levitt, S.D., Winning isn't everything: Corruption in sumo wrestling (2002) American Economic Review, 92, pp. 1594-1605. , 5; Kagel, J.H., Kagel, J., Roth, A.E., Auctions: A survey of experimental research (1995) Handbook of Experimental Economics, pp. 501-585. , Princeton University Press Princeton; Karahan, G.R., Razzolini, L., Shughart Ii, W.F., Centralized versus decentralized decision-making in a county government setting (2002) Economics of Governance, 3, pp. 101-115; Lengwiler, Y., Wolfstetter, E., Dimitri, N., Piga, G., Spagnolo, G., Corruption in procurement auctions (2006) Handbook of Procurement, pp. 412-429. , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Lien, D.D., A note on competitive bribery games (1986) Economics Letters, 22, pp. 337-341; (2007) Bribery in Public Procurement: Methods, Actors and Counter-measures, , OECD OECD Publishing; Rose-Ackerman, S., (1999) Corruption and Government: Causes, Consequences, and Reform, , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Selten, R., Stoecker, R., End behavior in sequences of finite prisoner's dilemma supergames (1986) Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 7, pp. 47-70. , 1; (2007) The 2007 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, , http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi, Transparency International Retrieved January 31, 2008";Article;Final;All Open Access, Bronze, Green;Scopus;2-s2.0-50249164769

Then, the dynamic identity authentication policy model is acquired according to Policy, Protection, Detection, and Response (P2DR) model and architecture. Finally, the identity authentication policy model based on P2DR is proposed for the security requirement of EPS. Considering all kinds of factors such as policy, cost, working scope and so on, this policy model can adjust the modes of EPS dynamically and realize the homeostasis among 'security, cost and efficiency' for different security requirements and users in each stage of e-procurement.;"E-procurement system; Identity authentication; Information security; Policy";"Access control; Authentication; Computer networks; Construction; Dynamic response; Dynamical systems; Dynamics; Earnings; Industrial economics; Mechanics; Research; (R ,s ,S) policy; E Procurement; Identity authentication; Policy modeling; Security requirements; Dynamic models";;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-39149084377
