This study identifies processes with anomalies and generates a model for detecting possible corruption in the assignment of process qualification parameters in public procurement. A multi-phase model was used (the identification of anomalies and generation of the detection model), which uses different algorithms, such as clustering (K-Means), Self-Organizing map (SOM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). SOM was used to determine the level of influence of each rating parameter, K-Means to create groups by clustering, semi-supervised learning with SVM and PCA to generate a model to detect anomalies in the processes. By means of a case study, four groups of processes were obtained, highlighting the presence of the group “null economic offer” where the values for the economic offer do not exceed 1%, and a greater weight is given to other qualification parameters, which include direct contracting. The processes in this cluster are considered anomalous. Following this methodology, a semi-supervised learning model is built for the detection of anomalies, which obtains an accuracy of 95%, allowing the detection of procedures where the aim is to benefit a particular supplier by means of the qualification assignment parameters. © 2021 by the authors.

Theoretically, we explore the governance role played by organized criminal groups in corruption networks, facilitating corrupt transactions by lowering search costs, bargaining costs, and enforcement cots. Empirically, the analysis exploits a rare empirical setup of proven cases of both EGO presence and absence in contract awards by Italian municipalities. We use traditional regression and supervised machine-learning methods for identifying and validating proxy indicators for EGO presence in public procurement such as single bidding or municipal spending concentration. Internal validity of our models is very high, 85% of unseen contracts are correctly classified. External validity is moderate, our predicted EGO presence score correlates with established indicators of organized criminality across the whole of Italy and Europe with a linear correlation coefficient of about 0.4. © 2021 The Authors.

With the proliferation of e-procurement systems in the public sector, anti-corruption agencies and watchdog organizations have access to valuable sources of information with which to identify transactions that are likely to become troublesome and why. In this article, we discuss the promises and challenges of using machine learning models to predict inefficiency and corruption in public procurement. We illustrate this approach with a dataset with more than two million public procurement contracts in Colombia. We trained machine learning models to predict which of them will result in corruption investigations, a breach of contract, or implementation inefficiencies. We then discuss how our models can help practitioners better understand the drivers of corruption and inefficiency in public procurement. Our approach will be useful to governments interested in exploiting large administrative datasets to improve the provision of public goods, and it highlights some of the tradeoffs and challenges that they might face throughout this process. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters;Corruption, Forecasting, Inefficiency, Machine learning, Public procurement;;"Acevedo, K.M., Bornacelly, I.D., Panel municipal del CEDE (2014), Universidad de los Andes-CEDE; Ades, A., Tella, R.D., Rents, competition and corruption (1999) American Economic Review, 89 (4), pp. 982-993; Adsera, A., Boix, C., Payne, M., Are you being served?

It is estimated that between 2% and 5% of the global GDP is lost annually because of such practices, not only directly impacting public services and private sector development but also strengthening organized crime. However, most law enforcement agencies do not have the capability to carry out systematic corruption risk assessment leveraging on the availability of data related to public procurement. The currently prevailing approach employed by Brazilian law enforcement agencies to detect companies involved in potential cases of fraud consists in receiving circumstantial evidence or complaints from whistleblowers. As a result, a large number of companies involved in fraud remain undetected and unprosecuted. The decision support system (DSS) described in this work addresses these existing limitations by providing a tool for systematic analysis of public procurement. It allows the law enforcement agencies to establish priorities concerning the companies to be investigated. This DSS incorporates data mining algorithms for quantifying dozens of corruption risk patterns for all public contractors inside a specific jurisdiction, leading to improvements in the quality of public spending and to the identification of more cases of fraud. These algorithms combine operations research tools such as graph theory, clusterization, and regression analysis with advanced data science methods to allow the identification of the main risk patterns, such as collusion between bidders, conflicts of interest (e.g., a politician who owns a company contracted by the same government body where he or she was elected), and companies owned by a potentially straw person used for disguising its real owner (e.g., beneficiaries of cash conditional transfer programs). The DSS has already led to a detailed analysis of large public procurement datasets, which add up to more than 50 billion dollars. Moreover, the DSS provided strategic inputs to investigations conducted by federal and state agencies. © 2020 The Authors.

This has motivated entities to promote anti-corruption strategies, most of these strategies are manual and social in nature. In order to effectively (efficiently and efficiently) predict and detect corruption, it is necessary to carry out automatic processes. This review seeks to establish the fundamental concepts of the state of the art related to solutions that apply anti-corruption strategies and based on this, analyze the feasibility of creating a model for detecting and identifying corruption in the public procurement process. The results show that combining statistical techniques with information technologies (artificial intelligence, big data, data mining, among others) is a promising line of research in this area of application.

In Indonesia, there are seven types of corruption cases handled by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). One of the corruption cases which is detrimental to the state occurs in public procurement, such as the procurement of goods/services. This case is the second most corrupt crime after bribery in Indonesia. In this research, wetry to identify potential corruption from auction data on goods/services procurement in government. By using Big Data technology, it is expected that the process can be carried out immediately to assist the KPK in identifying potential corruption in goods/services procurement auctions. © 2020 IEEE.;Big Data, Corruption, Machine Learning;"Developing countries; Data technologies; Good governances; Indonesia; Procurement auction; Public procurement; Crime";"Sabani, A., Farah, M.H., Sari Dewi, D.R., Indonesia in the spotlight: Combating corruption through ICT enabled governance (2019) Procedia Computer Science; (2019) Statistik TPK Berdasarkan Jenis Perkara Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi, , http://www.kpk.go.id/id/statistik/penindakan/tpk-berdasarkan-jenisperkara., Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi, [Accessed: 18-Apr-2020]; (2015) The World Bank, Benchmarking Public Procurement 2016: Assessing Public Procurement Systems in 77 Economies, , The World Bank; (2018) Report to the Nations-Global Study on Occupational Fraud and Abuse: Asia Pacific, , http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2222608, ACFE, Asia Pacific Ed; Huda, S.N., Setiani, N., Pulungan, R., Winarko, E., Potential fraudulent behaviors in e-procurement implementation in Indonesia (2017) IOP Conf.

In this study, we analyzed differentness kinds of corruption like (bribery, collusion embezzlement, misappropriation, fraud, abuse of discretion, favoritism, nepotism), and six types of Artificial Intelligence techniques (classification, regression, clustering, prediction, outlier detection, and visualization). The methodology proposed by Torres-Carrion was used, and four research questions were raised, which allow knowing the types of research carried out, the characteristics of the organizations in which the investigations are carried out, the technological tools, and data mining methodologies and techniques. The search was done in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, getting 102 articles published between 2015 and 2019. The primary data mining techniques used are logistic models, neural networks, Bayesian networks, supported vector machines, and decision trees. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Artificial Intelligence, Corruption, Data mining, Procurement, Systematic literature review;"Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Crime; Decision trees; Trees (mathematics); Artificial intelligence techniques; Corruption; Procurement; Public procurement; Research questions; Supported vector machines; Systematic literature review; Technological tools; Data mining";"Báez Gómez, J.E., Relación entre el Índice de Control de la Corrupción y algunas variables sociales, económicas e institucionales (2013) Nómadas.

This article uses machine learning tools to analyze a large dataset of public contracts from across Europe, in order to identify the conditions under which close connections, defined both in terms of repeated interaction, as well as geographical dispersion, appear. Previous theoretical results suggest that close ties should emerge as an enforcement mechanism in settings characterized by weak outside enforcement, such as those involving corruption. Results from random forest models show support for this hypothesis, along with identifying other structural determinants of the outcome. The most striking finding is that even after accounting for numerous potential confounders, major differences in terms of average diversity levels between countries persist, and these differences map onto an indicator of governance quality and corruption, but not at all on income per capita. These findings point to the centrality of the structure of interactions between private and public actors for understanding governance outcomes. Copyright © V.K.

Since it almost always focuses on the prediction of corrupt competition, the calculation of various indices and indications of corruption to the data itself are very difficult to come by. These data sets usually have very few observations, especially accurately labelled ones. The prevention or detection of compromised public procurement processes is definitely a crucial step, related to the initial phase of public procurement, i.e., the phase of publication of the notice. The aim of this paper is to compare prediction models using text-mining techniques and machine-learning methods to detect suspicious tenders, and to develop a model to detect suspicious one-bid tenders. Consequently, we have analyzed tender documentation for particular tenders, extracted the content of interest about the levels of all bids and grouped it by procurement lots using machine-learning methods. A model that includes the aforementioned components uses the most common text classification algorithms for the purpose of prediction: naive Bayes, logistic regression and support vector machines. The results of the research showed that knowledge in the tender documentation can be used for detection suspicious tenders. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Starting from a contextualization about the meaning and impact of big data and the technology of data analytics in the public sector, six experiences are presented conducted by the Comptroller General's Office (CGU), the main audit body of the Brazilian government, of data mining and predictive analytics used to prevent risks, irregularities and fraud in public procurement and contracts. In general, these initiatives allowed an optimization of the human and organizational resources involved in the audit activity, prioritizing situations in which potential irregularities were, detected. The article also emphasizes that, despite the legitimate purpose of administrative efficiency, the practice of data mining, using big data, must be compatible with the principles of due process of law, public transparency and the protection of the fundamental rights. of citizens, especially the protection of their personal data. © 2019, Revista General de Derecho Administrativo.

For this reason, the detection of anomalies in public procurements can improve the quality of purchases, and consequently enable a better quality of life in the country through the correct use of public funds. In this paper, we use as a case study the public contracts of Paraguay, which are in the open data format of the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS), for training an unsupervised learning model for anomaly detection, based on the Isolation Forest algorithm. The resulting classification allows to obtain a measurement or scoring of contracts that can be used to identify outliers. Given a local dataset of cases of procurement processes with protests with judgments in favor of the protestant or with citizen complaints, the preliminary results show that the trained model classifies as anomalous more than 45% of the potentially anomalous dataset. A detailed validation considering the public procurements local regulations is needed, with the purpose of building a tool that allows an intelligent sampling of contracts with atypical behavior to review, applicable to Paraguay and other countries that implement the OCDS. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

The main contribution of the project is the development of a data science-based solution to systematically assist managing authorities to increase the effectiveness and efficiency when analysing fraud and corruption cases. The tool combines descriptive and predictive machine learning models with advanced statistics and visualisations. In this regard, we define a number of specific requirements in terms of questions and data analyses, as well as risk indicators and other anomaly patterns. Each of these requirements will materialize in specific visualisations, reports and dashboards included in the final solution. Several internal and external data sources are analysed and assessed to explore possible irregularities in budget and cash management, public service accounts, salaries, disbursement, grants, subsidies, etc. The project has already resulted in an initial prototype (SALER Analytics) successfully tested by the governing bodies of Valencia, in Spain. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Corruption, Data science, Public procurement;"Budget control; Compensation (personnel); Crime; Data mining; Data Science; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Visualization; Anomaly patterns; Cash Management; Corruption; Effectiveness and efficiencies; External data sources; Governing bodies; Machine learning models; Public procurement; Public administration";"Bertot, J.C., Jaeger, P.T., Grimes, J.M., Using ICTs to create a culture of transparency: E-government and social media as openness and anti-corruption tools for societies (2010) Gov.

Public procurement has a huge potential to stimulate the economy by providing opportunities to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME's), if done correctly. The major bottleneck in the current procurement process is inefficient tendering and selection of bids. Tanzania still doesn't have a fully operational e-procurement platform. This paper analyses how Innovation can be used in Public Procurement to ensure true fairness, competitiveness, transparency and value for money in public projects. Technology is a powerful tool to influence business culture. This paper describes the overall Procurement Management practices used in Tanzania, the challenges, how the procurement process affects public projects (i.e. Time and Cost), how e-evaluation as a component of e-procurement can reduce Time and Cost of Public Projects and Finally the Project Plan and scope for the implementation of an efficient e-tendering system. © 2017 IEEE.;E-evaluation, E-procurement, E-tendering, Innovation, Public Procurement, Public Projects, Tanzania;"Artificial intelligence; Costs; Innovation; e-Evaluation; e-Procurement; E-tendering; Public procurement; Public project; Tanzania; Software engineering";"Kayed, A., Colomb, R., (2002) Book Chapter: B2B Electronic Commerce: The Electronic Tendering in Business to Business Electronic Commerce, , Challenges & Solutions, Idea Group Publishing Hershey, USA; Kerridge, S., Halaris, C., Mentzas, G., Kerridge, S., Virtual tendering and bidding in the construction sector (2000) Proceedings of EC-Web 2000, pp. 379-388. , Springer; Lai, S.C., (2007) E-Tendering with Web Services: A Case Study on the Tendering Process of Building Construction, pp. 582-588. , July, 9-13; Abdullah, A., (2008) Noor: Web-based Prequalification for Tender Management System, 2, pp. 1-6. , June 30 2008-July; (2014) Public Procurement Act, (3). , Government of Tanzania. of; Mamiro, R.G., (2015) Value for Money, the Limping Pillar in Public Procurement-Experience from Tanzania, , Institute of Accountancy, Arusha; Fjeldstad, O.H., Fighting fiscal corruption: Lessons from the Tanzania Revenue Authority (2012) Public Administration and Development, 23 (2), pp. 165-175";Conference Paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85030870749
