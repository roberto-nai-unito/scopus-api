On average, firms exposed by the anti-corruption program grow larger after the audits, despite experiencing a decrease in procurement contracts. We manually collect new data on the details of thousands of corruption cases, through which we uncover a large heterogeneity in our firm-level effects depending on the degree of involvement in corruption. Using investment-, loan-, and worker- level data, we show that the average exposed firms adapt to the loss of government contracts by changing their investment strategy. They increase capital investment and borrow more to finance such investment, while there is no change in their internal organization. We provide qualitative support to our results by conducting new face-to-face surveys with business owners of government-dependent firms. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.;Brazil, Corruption, Firms, Government contracts, Investment;;"Akey, P., Valuing changes in political networks: evidence from campaign contributions to close congressional elections (2015) Rev.

In particular, it investigates how accounting can fight or facilitate corruption Design/methodology/approach: The study takes a qualitative approach, analyzing one of the worst recent Italian cases of corruption, the “MOSE” trial. Documents produced during the trial are analyzed. Findings: The findings contribute to our understanding of how the (mis)use of accounting can help to build a “sustainable” corruption network, and be used to create, maintain and share corruptive cash flows. Participating actors can use accounting tools to coordinate their actions and organize their misconduct. Accounting may also reveal the existence of such networks, however, by enabling the fiscal police to discover tax fraud, and by reconstructing how a corruption network functions from records kept to manage internal cash flows and the provision of other benefits. Practical implications: Because corruption is a worldwide phenomenon, a better understanding of how it functions may lead (among other things) to the identification of more effective prevention measures. Particular attention should be paid to events that favor corruption, such as extraordinary occurrences, huge amounts of public resources and new institutional structure without appropriate control and balance tools. Originality/value: Given the specific features of episodes of corruption, qualitative studies on this topic are scarce. Little is known about corruption processes, and even less about the part that accounting can play in them. The MOSE case offers some intriguing insight, showing how accounting can be used to build a “sustainable” corruption network by collecting slush funds and facilitating benefit-sharing among individuals. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Corruption, Corruption network, Public procurement, Slush funds;;"Aguilera, R.V., Vadera, A.K., The dark side of authority: antecedents, mechanisms, and outcomes of organizational corruption (2008) Journal of Business Ethics, 77 (4), pp. 431-449; Albrecht, W.S., Albrecht, C.O., Albrecht, C.C., Zimbelman, M.F., (2011) Fraud Examination, , South-Wester, Cengage Learning, Mason, OH; Alt, J.E., Lassen, D.D., Political and judicial checks on corruption: evidence from American state governments (2008) Economics and Politics, 20 (1), pp. 33-61; Anand, V., Ashforth, B.E., Joshi, M., Business as usual: the acceptance and perpetuation of corruption in organizations (2004) Academy of Management Perspectives, 18 (2), pp. 39-53; Barbieri, G., Giavazzi, F., (2014) Corruzione a Norma di Legge: la Lobby Delle Grandi Opere che Affonda L'Italia, , Rizzoli, Milano; Beeri, I., Navot, D., Local political corruption: potential structural malfunctions at the central – local, local – local and intra-local levels (2013) Public Management Review, 15 (5), pp. 712-739; Beets, S.D., Understanding the demand-side issues of international corruption (2005) Journal of Business Ethics, 57 (1), pp. 65-81; Benston, G.J., Hartgraves, A.L., Enron: what happened and what we can learn from it (2002) Journal of Accounting and Public Policy, 21 (2), pp. 105-127; Bertrand, O., Lumineau, F., Partenerns in crime: the effects of diversity on the longevity of cartels (2016) Academy of Management Journal, 59 (3), pp. 983-1008; Brody, R.G., Melendy, S.R., Perri, F.S., Commentary from the American Accounting Association's 2011 annual meeting panel on emerging issues in fraud research (2012) Accounting Horizons, 26 (3), pp. 513-531; Cantone, R., Di Feo, G., (2016) Il Male Italiano: Liberarsi Dalla Corruzione Per Cambiare Il Paese, , Bur, Milano; Caperchione, E., Demirag, I., Grossi, G., Public sector reforms and public private partnerships: overview and research agenda (2017) Accounting Forum, 41 (1), pp. 1-7; Changwony, F.K., Paterson, A.S., Accounting practice, fiscal decentralization and corruption (2019) The British Accounting Review, 51 (5), p. 100834; Corrado, G., Rossetti, F., Public corruption: a study across regions in Italy (2018) Journal of Policy Modeling, 40 (6), pp. 1126-1139; Coxson, S.L., Assessment of Armenian local government corruption potential (2009) Public Administration and Development, 29 (3), pp. 193-203; de Graaf, G., Portraits of corruption: towards a contextual theory of corruption (2004) Proceedings of the EGPA 2004 Annual Conference, Four Months After: Administering the New Europe; Della Porta, D., Vannucci, A., The resources of corruption: some reflections from the Italian case (1997) Crime, Law and Social Change, 27 (3-4), pp. 231-254; Della Porta, D., Vannucci, A., Corruption and anti-corruption: the political defeat of ‘clean hands’ in Italy (2007) West European Politics, 30 (4), pp. 830-853; Earle, J.S., Spicer, A., Peter, K.S., The normalization of deviant organizational practices: wage arrears in Russia, 1991-98 (2010) Academy of Management Journal, 53 (2), pp. 218-237; Eisenhardt, K.M., Building theories from case study research (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14 (4), pp. 532-550; Ejiogu, A., Ejiogu, C., Ambituuni, A., The dark side of transparency: does the Nigeria extractive industries transparency initiative help or hinder accountability and corruption control?

Blockchain technology facilitates the procedures and processes of administrative records via smart contracts because of properties such as timeproof sealing and data record immutability. In the present paper, we present a truthfulness governance approach which uses a permissioned model based on neural blockchain technology and smart contracts to create blocks within which all information is held in an on-chain consensus system to avoid corruption in the field of public procurement. Our proposal represents a scalable, efficient, innovative solution that is aligned with Sustainable Development Goal requirements and constitutes a ‘Decentralized Autonomous Organization’ in itself. Our model highlights the benefits of blockchain technology in terms of transparency, immutability, security, inclusiveness and disintermediation in order to create new anticorruption policies and technical solutions. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.;anticorruption token, digital administration, e-government, e-procurement, governance, Neural blockchain, SDG 16;;"Aarvik, P., Artificial intelligence - a promising anti corruption tool in development settings?

It is a relatively young instrument born as an experimental project designed to solve problems for particular conditions of crime and corruption in the Italian territory. This work aims to understand if the “White List” tool can represent a reliable legality tool for the contracting station and representation for firms registered in these lists, an incentive to obtain awards for faster times of public procurement. Through a descriptive survey, we will try to photograph the “White List” phenomenon by comparing firms belonging to these lists with companies not belonging to them but which are similar in terms of size and economic sector. The comparison takes off some differences in the financial structure of the two groups of companies. in particular, the White List’s firms show a better profitability and a lower recourse to third-party capital. © 2021 by the authors.

The aim of the article is to measure the effect of blockchain technology on international trade and financial business. The paper uses methods of analysis and synthesis of information from researched academic articles, government programs, reports, and statistical data. The averages and regression analysis (in particular, the calculation of the Pearson coefficient) are used for getting analytical results. Graphic methods are used to summarize the information and to present the understudy materials. According to the results of the study, it can be concluded that blockchain technology has great potential for the development of international trade and financial business. It is possible by improving the settlement of international trade, applying smart contracts in the formation of the transaction, improving logistics chains, and reducing the speed of information and delivery processing, increasing the economic turnover. Blockchain has a positive impact on reducing costs for merchants and the banking sector, predicted by 2030 to decrease costs by 11% using this technology. The technology will have a very significant impact on the development of intellectual property, which could be particularly activated by the possibility of reducing the impact of pirated copying. It is possible to reduce corruption and fraud by applying blockchain technology in public procurement, which currently accounts for the bulk of international trade. Blockchain technology will add $3 trillion in additional business value by 2030 and $866 bln in international trade, including financial business.

This paper aims to investigate how the media has engaged with public procurement, using UK newspapers as a case example. Design/methodology/approach: The method consisted of searching Nexis database for news articles on public procurement; automatic extraction of article attributes such as length, section, authorship; and manually coding each article for its theme and industry context. This produced quantitative indicators about the extent and focus of press coverage on public procurement. Findings: Press coverage of public procurement increased between 1985 and 2018. The focus of coverage has been on governance failure and socio-economic policy. Governance failure, which includes corruption, cronyism and supplier malpractice, is associated with construction, outsourcing and professional services sectors. Socio-economic policy, which includes supporting small suppliers and favouring domestic industry, is associated with manufacturing, defence and agriculture. Research limitations/implications: The analysis included UK media only. While the trends observed on the extent and focus of public procurement news coverage likely reflect the situation in other countries, international comparative research is still required. Practical implications: Government officials should be more proactive in countering the “negativity bias” in news coverage of public procurement by showcasing projects where value-for-money has been achieved, services have been successfully delivered and social value has been realised. Social implications: The media accentuates the negatives of public procurement and omits positive developments. The end-result is a selective and, at times, self-serving media narrative that is likely to engender cynicism towards public procurement. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study on media coverage of public procurement. It highlights that while there are similarities between media and academic treatment of public procurement, particularly in relation to its socio-economic side, the media emphasises governance failings and negative developments to a greater extent. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.";News reporting, Public procurement, Secondary data;;"Allen, B., Broader outcomes in procurement policy – a case of New Zealand pragmatism (2021) Journal of Public Procurement, 21 (3); Arrowsmith, S., Horizontal policies in public procurement: a taxonomy (2010) Journal of Public Procurement, 10 (2), pp. 149-186; Basheka, B., Economic and political determinants of public procurement corruption in developing countries: an empirical study from Uganda (2011) Journal of Public Procurement, 11 (1), pp. 33-60; Benford, R.D., An insider's critique of the social movement framing perspective (1997) Sociological Inquiry, 67 (4), pp. 409-430; Benton, M., Frazier, P.J., The agenda setting function of the mass media at three levels of “information holding (1976) Communication Research, 3 (3), pp. 261-274; Bolton, P., Government procurement as a policy tool in South Africa (2006) Journal of Public Procurement, 6 (3), pp. 193-217; Brien, S., Hine, L., Complex products and comprehensive service agreements: a case study of outsourcing in contract cities (2015) Journal of Public Procurement, 15 (2), pp. 150-176; Csáki, C., Gelléri, P., Conditions and benefits of applying decision technological solutions as a tool to curb corruption within the procurement process: the case of Hungary (2005) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 11 (5-6), pp. 252-259; Dimitri, N., ‘Best value for money’ in procurement (2013) Journal of Public Procurement, 13 (2), pp. 149-175; Dooley, K.J., Using manifest content analysis in purchasing and supply management research (2016) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 22 (4), pp. 244-246; (2021) UK government ‘drowning’ in PPE contract requests, court told, , 22nd April; Fiss, P.C., Hirsch, P.M., The discourse of globalization: framing and sensemaking of an emerging concept (2005) American Sociological Review, 70 (1), pp. 29-52; Flynn, A., Grieving the loss of a public contract: de la rue and the Brexit passport (2020) Journal of Public Procurement, 20 (1), pp. 20-37; Flynn, A., McKevitt, D., Davis, P., The impact of size on small and medium-sized enterprise public sector tendering (2015) International Small Business Journal: Researching Entrepreneurship, 33 (4), pp. 443-461; Gamson, W.A., Modigliani, A., Media discourse and public opinion on nuclear power: a constructionist approach (1989) American Journal of Sociology, 95 (1), pp. 1-37; Gelderman, C.J., Paul, W.T., Brugman, M.J., Public procurement and EU tendering directives – explaining non‐compliance (2006) International Journal of Public Sector Management, 19 (7), pp. 702-714; Glas, A.H., Schaupp, M., Essig, M., An organizational perspective on the implementation of strategic goals in public procurement (2017) Journal of Public Procurement, 17 (4), pp. 572-605; Grandia, J.J., Kruyen, P.P., Assessing the implementation of sustainable public procurement using quantitative text-analysis tools: a large-scale analysis of Belgian public procurement notices (2020) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 26 (4), pp. 1006-1027; Greasley, S., Mutual dependence or state dominance?

Worldwide, collusion is a pervasive phenomenon in public sector procurement. It undermines the benefits of a competitive marketplace and wastes taxpayers' money. More often than not, contracting authorities cannot identify non-competitive bids and frequently award contracts at higher prices than they would have in collusion's absence. This paper tests the accuracy of eleven Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for detecting collusion using collusive datasets obtained from Brazil, Italy, Japan, Switzerland and the United States. While the use of ML in public procurement remains largely unexplored, its potential use to identify collusion are promising. ML algorithms are quite information-intensive (they need a substantial number of historical auctions to be calibrated), but they are also highly flexible tools, producing reasonable detection rates even with a minimal amount of information. © 2021;Auction, Collusion, Construction, Contracting, Machine learning, Procurement;"Commerce; Costs; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Collusion; Collusion detection; Competitive marketplace; Contracting; Illegal practices; Machine learning algorithms; Procurement; Procurement auction; Public procurement; Public sector procurements; Taxation";"Curtis, F., Maines, P., Closed competitive bidding (1973) Omega., 1, pp. 613-619; Signor, R., Love, P.E.D., Oliveira, A., Lopes, A.O., Oliveira, P.S., Public infrastructure procurement: detecting collusion in capped first-priced auctions (2020) J.

The latter, being a driver of development nevertheless are capable of introducing new types of risk of fraud and manifestations of corruption-generating factors. The article examines the causes of fraud, types of economic crimes and types of fraudsters. Fraud is also manifested when describing the risks associated with procurement procedures, which were systematized by the authors. It is noted that the synergistic effect from the combination of the interaction of several risks can be significant and lead to a decrease in interest in a particular model and (or) procurement system, as well as to level the effect of the introduction of procurement procedures on a national scale. Based on the study of models of public procurement organization in a number of countries, the general conclusion was made that, despite the differences, all of them are based on the principles of minimizing the costs associated with organizing the procurement process and increasing the degree of competition based on the involvement of the maximum number of bidders. A special role in the development of procurement is assigned to information technologies, which will form the image of future “electronic platforms”. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Fraud, Fraud detection techniques, Procurement;;"Soylu, A., Lech, T., Browse, visualise, analyse EU procurement data (2020) Ercim News, 120, pp. 45-46; Trufanova, A.S., Afanassyev, M.V., Purchase procedure initiation stage: Features of the carrying out and possible ways of optimization (2020) Procurement Management: Modern Theory and Practice: Materials of II All-Russian Conference, Pp. 103–105.

BIM allows the construction of a digital scale model of the asset to be built, ensuring the early detection of conflicts and interferences, enabling communication between the different participant agents, and facilitating the processes in the maintenance and management phase. Studies on the subject are many and varied. However, very few works refer to the inclusion of BIM in the public procurement stage, one of the most complex and competitive stages within the asset’s life cycle. A bibliographic review has been conducted about the BIM situation in the AECO sector contracts, the existing problems and the possible solutions to implement. In the specific field of public procurement, Spain has made great progress, especially at the regional level. During 2020, a total of 440 tenders with BIM requirements were published, with an investment volume of EUR 752 million, which represents an increase of 230% compared to 2017. The aim of this research is to analyze the Spanish public procurement, highlighting the progress made so far in the implementation of this technology, as well as to develop a proposal of BIM requirements that, in general, could be used as a reference for tenders of the AECO sector in the country. With this objective, a selection of twenty relevant public tenders is made, covering both the building and infrastructure fields. The requirements address areas such as: BIM uses, BIM deliverables, model structure, Level of Development, Common Data Environment, classification systems, standards or quality control. © 2021 by the authors.

Fraudulent activity associated with public procurement contracts accounts for losses of billions of euros every year. Thus, it is of utmost relevance to explore analytical frameworks that can help public authorities identify agents that are more susceptible to irregular activities. Here, we use standard network science methods to study the co-bidding relationships between firms that participate in public tenders issued by the 184 municipalities of the State of Ceará (Brazil) between 2015 and 2019. We identify 22 groups/communities of firms with similar patterns of procurement activity, defined by their geographic and activity scopes. The profiling of the communities allows us to highlight organizations that are more susceptible to market manipulation and irregular activities. Our work reinforces the potential application of network analysis in policy to unfold the complex nature of relationships between market agents in a scenario of scarce data. © 2021, The Author(s).;Brazil, Co-bidding network, Data mining, Network analysis, Public procurement;;"Adjei-Bamfo, P., Maloreh-Nyamekye, T., Ahenkan, A., The role of e-government in sustainable public procurement in developing countries: a systematic literature review (2019) Resour Conserv Recycl, 142, pp. 189-203;

This study identifies processes with anomalies and generates a model for detecting possible corruption in the assignment of process qualification parameters in public procurement. A multi-phase model was used (the identification of anomalies and generation of the detection model), which uses different algorithms, such as clustering (K-Means), Self-Organizing map (SOM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). SOM was used to determine the level of influence of each rating parameter, K-Means to create groups by clustering, semi-supervised learning with SVM and PCA to generate a model to detect anomalies in the processes. By means of a case study, four groups of processes were obtained, highlighting the presence of the group “null economic offer” where the values for the economic offer do not exceed 1%, and a greater weight is given to other qualification parameters, which include direct contracting. The processes in this cluster are considered anomalous. Following this methodology, a semi-supervised learning model is built for the detection of anomalies, which obtains an accuracy of 95%, allowing the detection of procedures where the aim is to benefit a particular supplier by means of the qualification assignment parameters. © 2021 by the authors.

In the infrastructure sector, the three main project activities—design, production, and maintenance—are traditionally not procured in an integrated way, which results in sub-optimizations and a lack of life cycle perspective. As project actors are accustomed to traditional, non-integrated forms of contract, implementing integrated contracts imposes fundamental changes to the interdependencies among actors, resources, and activities. This study analyzes the interfaces among key project actors and the related interdependencies across design, production, and maintenance in Design–Build–Maintain contracts, and initiates a discussion on how to manage these interdependencies when implementing integrated contracts. This study of circular public procurement (CPP) focused on three infrastructure projects using integrated contracting and applied the industrial network approach (INA) to analyze interdependencies in how they may influence innovation and sustainable development. The study found significant obstacles to clients obtaining the benefits of integrated contracting and concludes that understanding interdependencies is necessary to implement integrated contracts successfully. The study contributes to the construction management literature by adapting the INA to contracting, and to the CPP literature by providing empirical evidence of sustainability and circularity in infrastructure projects. © 2021 by the authors.

The global pande-mic derived from Covid-9 forced the economy to look for sustainable alternatives but the reality was formed in overvalued contracts at their real prices, a situation that left the entire Ecuadorian territory in economic instability around the health emer-gency, without compliance individual and general that require all types of public contracts, have left the violation and direct affectation of the principle of transparency and social control. The State reformed and formulated different design structures to prevent the spread of the virus, but the excessive use of contracts has increasingly bled the financial system that supported Ecuador.

It assesses the determinants of firms’ bribe paying behavior and examine how bribe behavior affects two main sectors where corruption is rampant: taxation and government contracts. The paper shows that corruption in tax administration tends to be mainly a demand-side phenomenon. Paying a bribe requested by a public official is associated with a 16 percent increase in the share of sales not reported for tax purposes. In public procurement, the results suggest on the contrary that corruption is a supply-side phenomenon, with bribe transactions generally initiated by firms to secure public contracts. Firms supplying a bribe without a previous request by officials is associated with a 17 percent increase in the bribe paid to secure a government contract, more than three times the effect observed on the demand side of bribery. © 2021;Bribery, Corruption, Procurement, Tax evasion;;"Allingham, M.G., Sandmo, A., Income tax evasion: a theoretical analysis (1972) J.

The issuance of the Colombian anti-corruption code introduced the anti-competitive practice known as collusion in public procurement into competition law as a crime. This criminal policy aimed to punish more severely restrictive competition practices that adversely affect public procurement while discouraging their occurrence; however, it did not turn out as planned. The punishment conflicted with the leniency programs provided for in competition law. Through collaboration benefit programs, the legislator granted benefits such as the exemption of fines for those who reported anti-competitive conduct in exchange for information helpful to the authority. Nevertheless, when defining the leniency program, the legislator had not anticipated the possibility that restrictive competition conduct could be penalized by legal systems such as the criminal one. This disconnection between criminal policy and cooperation benefits would have discouraged people’s participation in cooperation benefit programs. Therefore, this article discusses the effectiveness of Colombian cooperation benefit programs offered by the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce regarding the classification of collusion as a crime. © 2021, Universidad de La Sabana.

However, anti-corruption campaigns often fail because the relevant policies need to be implemented by existing corrupt governments. This article studies the extent of bureaucrats’ heterogeneity in attitude to the problem of corruption. Due to the sensitivity of direct questions on corruption, we conduct the list experiment among public procurement officials in Russia. We show that female bureaucrats consider corruption an obstacle to public procurement development, and find no such evidence for male bureaucrats. This heterogeneity holds even at the high-level occupied positions. Although the negative attitude to corruption does not necessarily imply the anti-corruption activity by women, recognition of the problem seems to be a prerequisite for supporting an anti-corruption policy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.;Corruption, Gender heterogeneity, Item count technique, List experiment, Public procurement, Russia;;"Ades, A., Di Tella, R., Rents, Competition, and Corruption (1999) Am.

Despite the relevance of this phenomenon for corrupt practices from both a legal and a moral point of view, it has hitherto never been examined in a corruption context. We test for information avoidance in a framed public procurement experiment, in which a public official receives bribes from two competing firms and often faces a tradeoff between maximizing bribes and citizen welfare. In a treatment where officials have the option to remain ignorant about the implications of their actions for citizens, we find practically no evidence of information avoidance. We discuss possible reasons for the absence of willful ignorance in our experiment. © Copyright © 2021 Balafoutas, Sandakov and Zhuravleva.;C91, corruption, D73, D91, experiment, information avoidance, negative externality, Russia;;"Abbink, K., Dasgupta, U., Gangadharan, L., Jain, T., Letting the briber go free: an experiment on mitigating harassment bribes (2014) J.

It divides nodes into clusters according to the similarity of nodes or similarities in structure. This paper takes the EU public procurement contract network from 2008 to 2016 as an example, selects 6 countries with different data sizes, Austria, Cyprus, Germany, France, Hungary and Italy, analyzes the characteristics of the contract network and evaluates different community classification algorithms Performance. Taking the running speed and modularity as the evaluation criteria, comparing the Louvain algorithm and Girvan Newman algorithm the speed and accuracy of these 2 methods on different scale data sets, analyze the most suitable contract network community classification algorithm. Through analysis, the contract network is a sparse bipartite network, Louvain algorithm is a more suitable community detection method than Girvan Newman algorithm for contract networks. It has a fast running speed and high accuracy. © 2021 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.;Community Detection, Girvan Newman Algorithm, Louvain Algorithm, Social Network Analysis;"Classification (of information);

Especially in developing countries, corruption is a widespread issue due to secrecy and lack of transparency. An important instrument for transparency and accounta-bility assurance is the record which is managed and controlled by recordkeeping systems. Block-chain technology and more precisely blockchain-based smart contracts are emerging technological tools that can be used as recordkeeping systems and a tool to mitigate some of the fraud involving public procurement records. Immutability, transparency, distribution and automation are some of the features of smart contracts already implemented in several applications to avoid malicious human interference. In this paper, we discuss some of the frauds in public procurement, and we pro-pose smart contracts to automatize different stages of the public procurement procedure attempting to fix their biggest current weaknesses. The processes we have focused on include the bidding pro-cess, supplier habilitation and delivery verification. In the three subprocesses, common irregulari-ties include human fallibility, improper information disclosure and hidden agreements which con-cern not only governments but also civil society. To show the feasibility and usability of our pro-posal, we have implemented a prototype that demonstrates the process using sample data. © 2021 by the authors.

Performed well, public procurement helps a government to nurture competition, save money, and provide better public services. These benefits will not be reaped, however, if the system is not protected adequately from distortion by corruption and/or supplier collusion. This paper concludes that additional measures are required to protect the integrity of procurement processes in England & Wales through improving the distinct public procurement, anti-corruption and competition regimes and uniting them around a cohesive strategy. It advocates policy coordination and enhancements designed to yield major benefits to public procurement as the UK seeks to develop its own policies post-Brexit and to grapple with the demands that the Covid-19 pandemic has placed on public purchasing and the public purse. © 2021 The Authors.

On this matter, much of the discussion centers on the legal fulfillment of the procurement process, while there are fewer formal analyses related to the corporate features which are most likely to signal organized crime and corruption. The lack of systematic evidence on this subject has the potential to bias our understanding of corruption, making it overly focused on the public sector. Nevertheless, corruption scandals worldwide tell of the importance of taking a better look at the misuse and abuse of corporations for corrupt purposes. In this context, the research presented here seeks to contribute to the understanding of the criminal conspiracy of companies involved in public procurement corruption scandals under a network and complexity science perspective. To that end, we make use of a unique dataset of the corporate ownership and management information of four important and recently documented cases of corruption in Mexico, where hundreds of companies were used to embezzle billions of dollars. Under a bipartite network approach, we explore the relations between companies and their personnel (shareholders, legal representatives, administrators, and commissioners) in order to characterize their static and dynamic networked structure. In terms of organized crime and using different network properties, we describe how these companies connect with each other due to the existence of shared personnel with role multiplicity, leading to very different conspiracy networks. To best quantify this behavior, we introduce a heuristic network-based conspiracy indicator that together with other network metrics describes the differences and similarities among the networks associated with each corruption case. Finally, we discuss some public policy elements that might be needed to be considered in anti-corruption efforts related to corporate organized crime. © Copyright © 2021 Nicolás-Carlock and Luna-Pla.;complex networks, complex systems, conspiracy, corruption, corruption networks, legal studies, social network analysis (SNA), social physics;;"(2003) United Nations Convention against Corruption, , United Nations; (2017) UNECE Standard on a Zero Tolerance Approach to Corruption in PPP Procurement.

By mapping procurement markets as bipartite networks of issuers and winners of contracts, we can visualize and describe the distribution of corruption risk. We study the structure of these networks in each member state, identify their cores, and find that highly centralized markets tend to have higher corruption risk. In all EU countries we analyze, corruption risk is significantly clustered. However, these risks are sometimes more prevalent in the core and sometimes in the periphery of the market, depending on the country. This suggests that the same level of corruption risk may have entirely different distributions. Our framework is both diagnostic and prescriptive: It roots out where corruption is likely to be prevalent in different markets and suggests that different anti-corruption policies are needed in different countries. © 2020, The Author(s).;Big data, Corruption risk, Networks;"Commerce; Large dataset; Risk management; Anti-corruption; Bipartite network; Centralized market; Different distributions; EU countries; European union; Network science; Public procurement; Crime";"Scott, J.C., (1998) Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed, , Yale University Press, New Haven; Pappalardo, L., Vanhoof, M., Gabrielli, L., Smoreda, Z., Pedreschi, D., Giannotti, F., An analytical framework to nowcast well-being using mobile phone data (2016) Int.

Many new products appeared on the European market within these specifications, and many symbols have been used. The paper deals with the meaning of selected respiratory protection based on respirators symbols and markings (which appeared massively, especially after the pandemic situation in the spring of 2020), these symbols not being uniformly understood and well communicated. We also mention and discuss some of the problems related to setting the conditions of public procurement, which affect respirators. Thus, this review is an “informative guide” in facilitating the understanding and use of full knowledge of the most appropriate respiratory protective devices in various situations. © 2021 by the authors.

Unfortunately, law enforcement practice in Kazakhstan’s government procurement has shown a number of shortcomings in the system, including a weak system of control over funds spent resulting in thousands of corruption crimes in public procurement. In this regard, the present paper aims to overview issues relating to public procurement in Kazakhstan and formulate proposals on the subject. A variety of factors creating obstacles to the transparency of the system were observed, such as the inconsistency of data reported by the Ministry of Finance with those displayed on the electronic procurement website or difficulties in foreigners’ access to Kazakhstan’s government procurement, which hampers conducting competitive bidding. It was concluded that improvements in Kazakhstan’s government procurement should be focused on simplifying procurement procedures for bidders from abroad, consistent adjustment of the legislative and regulatory framework governing the system, and expanding the anti-corruption legal framework, with the specification of legal consequences for the violation of public procurement rules. © 2021, Ethical and Regulatory Issues, All rights reserved.;Bid, Corruption, Law, Regulation, Transparency;;"(2020) Any interest other than public interest, , https://rus.azattyq.org/a/kazakhstan-state-procurements-and-corruption/30791190.html, Azattyq.

This is known as the abnormally low bids (ALBs) problem in public procurement. An ALB is defined as an unrealistically low bid submitted to win an auction, an amount at which the auctioned service cannot be provided reliably. The current literature on ALBs in the humanitarian sector is rather sparse. This study presents a data-driven contract awarding framework that aims at eliminating ALBs so that service levels can be improved significantly. We conducted our analyses in the context of a developing country, where the transportation market data are almost non-existent. We derived our research questions through an exploratory research performed in African headquarters of an International Humanitarian Organization located in Kenya, and we constructed our quantitative models based on interviews with humanitarian practitioners and representatives of the carriers. We collected historical transport rate data from numerous carriers that serve multiple shippers, and we developed a methodology that can objectively identify ALBs, based on lane and contract specifications that are derived from the market. Furthermore, we estimated the effect of ALBs on service levels and we compared different contract settings under simulated market conditions. The results of the simulation analyses demonstrate that mitigating ALBs would improve the service levels significantly more than the commonly used fuel surcharge clauses in contracts. © 2020 Production and Operations Management Society;abnormally low bids, auctions, humanitarian logistics, public procurement, transportation management;;"Adewole, A., Logistics and supply chain infrastructure development in Africa (2019) Logistics and Global Value Chains in Africa, pp. 17-43. , Springer, Berlin; (2010) African Development Report, , Tech. rep., Oxford Press Inc, New York; Aloysius, J., Deck, C., Hao, L., French, R., An experimental investigation of procurement auctions with asymmetric sellers (2016) Prod.

Several arguments are presented in favor of the new theory, which, in the author’s opinion, are sufficiently valid. The author analyzes the dynamics of the development of the causes of the emergence of state and law and its influence on the transformation of the latest civilizations, which took place in history. Based on the historical chronology of the emergence and functioning of money, the author conventionally differs three stages in its development: 1) the period of the gold standard or a chronic shortage of monetary liquidity; 2) the period of paper money and inflationary pressure; 3) the digital money period. The author upholds a new position regarding the essence of international law, believing that international law is not a separate system of law, but only the result of the evolution of law from national to international, which became possible thanks to the development of the institution of money. The author shares his thoughts on the true reason for justifying the state’s right to war in international law a while back, expressed in a persistent shortage of monetary liquidity, which took place from the moment the first civilizations appeared until the 20th century. This article establishes a projection for the further development of state and law, including international law, alongside the inevitable transition of the world community to the digital money supply. The article reveals not only the vision of the new monetary system, its absolute transparency, and clarity but also the various opportunities we face in such a transition. In this regard, the states and the world community will come to clear and effective outcomes in management, to the practical abolition of corruption and economic crime, to legal methods of conducting all competitions and public procurement, to fair and effective justice, and the establishment of highly moral relations in society. © 2021 Lifescience Global";Digitalization, International monetary and financial law, Law, Monetary liquidity, Transparency;;"Aquinas, Th, On the rule of sovereigns (1990) Political structures in the feudalism epoch in Western Europe in the 6th-17th centuries, pp. 233-243. , Leningrad: Nauka; Asnawi, N., Setyaningsih, N.

For this above purpose, we have applied both theoretical methods such as analysis, synthesis, generalization, and empirical methods such as observation, etc. The research has yielded the following findings: 1) there are no one-size-fits-all solutions in the national governments' fight against the COVID-19 pandemic through the public procurement mechanism, except that national policies in this field intend to speed up the organisation of the public procurement procedures, which would shorten the time for the delivery of medical goods to healthcare facilities; 2) due to the current emergency conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, public procurements of medical supplies are taking place under the non-competitive procedure, i. e. with direct contracting of a specific vendor, which essentially increases corruption risks and allows for subjective decision making; 3) amid the increased corruption risks, there is a need to assign high priority to strengthening the public control (monitoring), as well as the governmental control over medical procurements; 4) saving of public funds as the underlying principle of some national public procurement systems becomes irrelevant in the face of such threats as the global COVID-19 pandemic; 5) it is quite difficult to speak of another principle - effective use of public funds - because we are now dealing with an emergency and the actors (both the government and the expert community) lack understanding of how things might potentially develop in the future. Thus, the authors offer the following solutions: 1) create temporary specialized bodies, with the cross-agency powers, at the national and regional levels, that would take on such functions as: coordination of procurements; needs analysis of particular areas in medical supplies; management of potential vendors. These measures may help make medical procurements as effective as possible in these current conditions; 2) develop special procedures (mechanisms), by national governments, for conducting checks of public procurements in the healthcare sector that are made as part of the response measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, because those check algorithms that are in place today cannot take into account the realities of this particular emergency situation and the conditions in which those procurements are made.";;"health care cost; human; pandemic; policy; COVID-19; Health Care Sector; Humans; Pandemics; Policy; SARS-CoV-2";;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85105687645

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that annually US$2 trillion of public funds is lost to corruption, yet governments have failed to respond with robust measures to deter such practice. Through comparing the debarment frameworks and policy goals across five jurisdictions, this article argues that Australia should consider adopting a discretionary debarment regime. By excluding bidders who have engaged in ‘corporate integrity offences’ from procurement contracts, debarment policies offer a potentially important mechanism in the fight against corruption. Debarment would not only protect the government from current threats, but it may also deter potential wrongdoers, encourage contractors to rehabilitate themselves, incapacitate actual offenders and facilitate development of a culture of compliance through the competitive advantage gains enjoyed by law-abiding firms. © The Author(s) 2020.;;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85096833478

This article examines the specifics of anti-corruption monitoring in the public procurement management system. The current situation in the field of monitoring public procurement in the Republic of Kazakhstan and the experience of other countries are analyzed, on the basis of which the problems of functioning in this area are highlighted. In order to solve these problems and develop the institution of anti-corruption monitoring in the public procurement management system of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the use of the advanced experience of other countries is proposed. The peculiarities of corruption in the field of public procurement in Kazakhstan are identified, and the main measures implemented to improve the effectiveness of combating corruption in the field of public procurement are disclosed. The need to strengthen the public monitoring of public procurement and the need to create public control centers in the field of public procurement are justified. © 2021 Mykolas Riomeris University.

The processes for public procurement and personnel recruitment represent an essential fraction of a country&#x2019;s public spending. It is crucial to have management tools for planning and controlling their execution, promoting transparency, increasing efficiency, and collecting enough information for accountability. All these features require an organizational change over time. Maturity models are tools for assessing different management dimensions resulting in some level of organizational maturity on an ordinal scale which can show null, partial, or total progress towards the desired state. In this paper, our object is to present an e-government maturity model for public procurement and personnel recruitment processes. The article describes the context and the problems faced, and introduces the research proposal. Subsequently, we present a literature review carried out to determine the current state of research in the field. In our Methodology we have used a known procedural model to support the design of the proposed model and have tested it with government buyers and personnel recruiters. These initial results show that users understand the questionnaires designed for the study, and their answers allow us to obtain deep validation. A tool with these characteristics can be very useful for measuring the degree of transparency in public entities, and thus reducing the levels of corruption in their processes.

This matter is especially important to Brazil where Operation Car Wash exposed widespread corruption and collusion affecting public procurement. Although focusing on Brazil, this article reflects on a broader academic and policy debate as to how a nation can escape from a ‘high-corruption’ equilibrium, especially one strengthened by its interaction with supplier collusion. In particular, whether endemic corruption can be combatted through an invigorated law enforcement push, combined with incremental reform, or whether some ‘big bang’ approach, with complete institutional overhaul, is required to establish a new equilibrium. The article notes that the Brazilian experience provides support for the hypothesis that, where corruption is endemic, better laws and law enforcement may be insufficient on their own to break a cycle and to remove the incentives and opportunities for corruption and collusion that exist. However, it also recognizes that, for many jurisdictions, wholesale big bang reform is unlikely to be feasible. It thus proposes a multi-pronged, and self-reinforcing, set of reforms to trigger change, concentrated on weaknesses diagnosed in the system. In particular, it suggests that where corruption affects public procurement, beyond specific adjustments to procurement, competition and anti-corruption laws, procurers, anti-corruption and competition enforcement agencies need to work closely together to coordinate policies, achieve synergies and to combat incentives and opportunities for corruption and collusion within procurement processes. Such reforms must be combined with measures to tackle broader factors contributing to systemic corruption. Although inspired by the Brazilian case study, the diagnosis and proposed reform strategy provides a workable model for use in other jurisdictions. © 2021 University of Toronto Press Inc..

Design/methodology/approach: Using the content analysis method, 23 transparency disclosure items from the Website Attribute Evaluation System (WAES) checklist were used to evaluate the transparency level of the e-procurement system. The data gathered from the WAES were analysed using frequency and percentage based on the various categories of transparency. Findings: The study reveals that the e-procurement system disclosed 17 out of the 23 WAES transparency disclosure items, which represents a transparency disclosure level of 73.91%. Of the five categories of disclosure, i.e. ownership, contact information, organizational information, citizen consequences and freshness, the detailed results show that the items are fully disclosed for only two categories, and for three categories, i.e. ownership, contact information and organizational information, the items are not fully disclosed. Research limitations/implications: The findings of the present research offer a positive indication that the government is moving in the right direction, particularly in efforts to reduce the corruption level in procurement activities and to improve the accountability level of the government. Originality/value: The present study is among the few studies that attempts to address a fundamental issue of transparency in the public procurement system that has an important relationship with the occurrence of corruption in procurement activities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Content analysis, Corruption, E-procurement, Public procurement, Transparency, Website attribute evaluation system;;"Abas Azmi, K.S., Abdul Rahman, A.A.L., E-Procurement: a tool to mitigate public procurement fraud in Malaysia?

This exploratory research included participation from expert auditors in public procurement was requested, who provided criteria that were quantified. We identified concepts and reporting that made it possible to reveal acts of corruption and fraud. Then, specialized bibliography was reviewed to decipher theories and methodologies that are applied in risk control processes. Audit reports were also studied to identify the causes and consequences of the application of public procurement processes. In contracting, risks were identified in all components of the model, which were made visible to make corrections or store a risk. In practice, this model can aid in decreasing corruption and fraud in the contracting process. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Contracts, Public contracts, Quality control, Quality management, Risk management, Rules and regulations;"Compliance control; Contracts; Process control; Risk management; Anti-corruption; Control model; Exploratory research; Procurement process; Public contracts; Public procurement; Quality management tools; Risks controls; Risks management; Rules and regulations; Crime";"Arellano, D., Corrupción como proceso organizacional: Comprendiendo la lógica de la desnormalización de la corrupción (2017) Contaduría Y Administración, 62 (3), pp. 810-826; Asamblea Nacional del Ecuador. https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20D ocuments/ECU/INT_CEDAW_ARL_ECU_18950_S.pdf.

A two-stage approach first estimates the potential waste score for each contract by employing a data envelopment analysis before isolating corruption from inefficiency by regressing waste scores on inefficiency determinants. This methodology is applied to Italian public works data for the period 2007 to 2017. Several validation tests testify to the robustness of the indicator, identifying actual corruption cases and demonstrating a significant correlation with a wide range of corruption indices available for Italy at the provincial and regional levels. Notwithstanding its usage as a risk-based assessment at the contract level, this indicator can also be used as a reputational instrument to assess contracting authorities and track their performance, conduct an evaluation of large funding programs, and support the enactment of risk-based audits. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.;Corruption, Governance, Public Infrastructure, Risk Assessment, Semi-Parametric Methods;;"Abramovitz, M., Resource and output trends in the United States since 1870 (1956) Am.

For this purpose, we propose using Neutrosophic Sociology or Neutrosociology, to use an indeterminate membership function that allows modeling the unawareness, doubts, and contradictions that may exist in the answers of any human being. The results obtained showed that the city of Guayaquil identifies as the main cause of acts of corruption in public procurement during the COVID 19 health emergency in the country: the interference of public servants as partners in different companies supply medical supplies. However, it does not recognize as a possible cause the existence of legal gaps in the public procurement norm. © 2021. Neutrosophic Sets and Systems.

Theoretically, we explore the governance role played by organized criminal groups in corruption networks, facilitating corrupt transactions by lowering search costs, bargaining costs, and enforcement cots. Empirically, the analysis exploits a rare empirical setup of proven cases of both EGO presence and absence in contract awards by Italian municipalities. We use traditional regression and supervised machine-learning methods for identifying and validating proxy indicators for EGO presence in public procurement such as single bidding or municipal spending concentration. Internal validity of our models is very high, 85% of unseen contracts are correctly classified. External validity is moderate, our predicted EGO presence score correlates with established indicators of organized criminality across the whole of Italy and Europe with a linear correlation coefficient of about 0.4. © 2021 The Authors.

The vast amounts of money awarded in public contracts, however, make public procurement extremely vulnerable to collusion among competitors and corruption of public officials. Although it is recognized that effective enforcement of these offences requires tight cooperation between competition agencies and other law enforcement authorities, there is still a lot of potential for improvement in many jurisdictions. The objective of this paper is to suggest key features of this cooperation which would facilitate effective catching of both colluding competitors and corrupt public officials involved in bid rigging schemes. © 2021 The Author.

In this paper, we use positive-unlabelled classification to attempt to separate public procurement auctions in the Russian Federation into auctions that are probably fair and those that are suspicious. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Positive-unlabelled classification, Public procurement, Single-bidder auctions;"Crime; Geographic isolation; Policy making; Positive-unlabeled classification; Procurement auction; Public procurement; Russian federation; Single-bidder auction; Structural factor; Commerce";"Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation: Report on results of the analytical event «Monitoring of public and corporate procurement development in Russian Federation in 2018» (2018). https://ach.gov.ru/promo/goszakupki-2018/index.html.

The proposed approach has allowed to theoretically substantiate the existence of new models of corrupt behavior, quasi-and totalitarian corruption, and subsequently to reveal cases of such agents’ behavior in the public procurement practice. In conditions of inefficient regulation, developed by the mala fide principal, bona fide agents in an effort to best meet the needs of society may violate certain provisions of regulatory legal acts or regulatory policy principles (quasi-corruption) whilst the mala fide agents do the same things for bribes (efficient corruption). On the other hand, in some cases the agents have to act in accordance with the inefficient regulation, being deprived of the possibility to violate it (totalitarian corruption). In the paper, the discussion of assumptions of different models, presented in the typology, including quasi-and totalitarian corruption, has been found in the academic literature. The paper examines the hypothesis that the proposition of Russian single-source procurement regulation which directly restricts annual small purchasing of contracting authorities provokes totalitarian corrupt behavior of buyers making them use electronic reverse auctions instead of single-source procurement to award small contracts. © 2021, Russian Presidental Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.

The authors argue that the state order is an important tool for regulating the economic and social spheres of life. However, there are several problems for which the taken measures are not enough for protecting small and medium-sized businesses from criminal elements and creating the conditions for fair business. The entry into force of the Federal Law “On the contract system in the procurement of goods, works, and services for state and municipal needs” (April 04, 2013 No. 44-FZ) and the Federal Law “On the procurement of goods, works, and services by certain types of legal entities” (July 18, 2011 No. 223-FZ) partially resolved some of the problems with organizing public procurement. However, some issues remained outside the scope of the law. The most important areas of the subsequent transformation in this area should be the limitation of corruption in public procurement and the growth of the control function in the bidding system. The authors proposed to introduce an anti-corruption examination of the documentation of applicants for participation in competitive procedures. Some other tools for improving the trading system that could comprehensively improve the efficiency and transparency of public procurement from small and medium-sized enterprises were also proposed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Corruption, Corruption schemes, Government support measures, Small and medium enterprises, State procurements;;"Federal State Statistics Service: Official Website (N.D.), , http://www.gks.ru; (2019) Federal Tax Service: United Registry of Subjects of Small and Medium Entrepreneurship, , https://ofd.nalog.ru/about.html; (2019) President of the Russian Federation: Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly, , http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/59863; (2007) State Duma of the Russian Federation: Federal Law “On the Development of Small and Medium Enterprises in the Russian Federation”, , (July 24, 2007 No. 209-FZ); (2011) State Duma of the Russian Federation: Federal Law “On Procurement of Goods, Works, and Services by Certain Types of Legal Entities”, , (July 18, 2011 No. 223-FZ); (2013) State Duma of the Russian Federation: Federal Law “On the Contract System in the Field of Procurement of Goods, Works, and Services to Ensure State and Municipal needs”, , (April 5, 2013 No. 44-FZ); (2018) Stolypin Growth Economy Institute: The Sector of Small and Medium Entrepreneurship: Russia and The World, , http://stolypin.institute/novosti/sektor-malogo-i-srednego-predprinimatelstva-rossiya-i-mir";Conference Paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85115128903

This study discusses a collaborative private-public partnership (PPP), supply chain advisory committee (SCAC), established during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to acquire personal protective equipment (PPE) and other critical supplies for a donation center in Toledo, Ohio, USA. This center serves the community and small businesses. This paper discusses the strategies, process and framework that were created to procure the needed items under a short lead time. The process of the partnership and outcomes are transferable and capable of being used by others to benefit society. Design/methodology/approach: The case study methodology was used to investigate and summarize the actions and events of the SCAC. The case presented was tracked from the initial call to action from a local emergency response organization, Lucas County Emergency Operation Center (EOC), through the first six months of the committee’s work. Data collection was completed through a triangulation of sources. Findings: The findings of this study reveal that public firms are vulnerable in a crisis. A crisis exposes the inequities in the supply chain and the need for public and private collaboration to use innovative procurement strategies. This study suggests that PPP procurement professionals benefit from working together. Both can learn from the limitations and benefits of collaborating. Practical implications: This study offers a framework on how PPPs can be established to procure PPE during a crisis. This study has practical implications for private and public firms seeking to collaborate for the good of society. Social implications: The findings of the study reveal that public firms are vulnerable in a crisis, which exposes the inequities in their supply chains. Private-public partnership (PPP) procurement professionals mutually benefit from working together as both can learn from each whether it is procuring PPE during a crisis or seeking to team up for the good of society. Society benefits when these organizations share solutions to problems rather than compete against one another during a crisis-situation such as a global pandemic. Supplies get to those who need them the most and information flows amongst the organizations to ensure equity in the availability of the supplies. Originality/value: This study contributes to the growing body of literature that argues that public procurement must be innovative and strategic to contribute to socially responsible solutions. Government regulations require public procurement to use competitive bidding for accountability, cost reduction and to reduce fraud. However, emergency situations require innovative procurement strategies. The use of innovative procurement strategies is typical in private procurement. During a crisis, supplier relationships, lead-time management and shared and transfer of knowledge must be leveraged to acquire critical items in a timely manner. A lack of innovative public procurement strategies constrains the public and small under resourced businesses, rendering them inoperable. This paper provides a case study of an effective PPP during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The authors used an online survey of Russian procurers and suppliers conducted in 2020 as the main data source. Methods based on comparison of descriptive statistics and distributions of answers for different subsamples were exploited. The analysis reveals that, despite the importance of fighting corruption and increasing competition, most participants consider the supply of high-quality goods and timely contract execution the most important criteria. COVID-19 has mitigated the rigidity of the regulation but exacerbated the ambiguity problem. During the pandemic, contract execution worsened. To improve procurement efficiency, the regulator should clearly specify requirements and consider the main participants’ interests. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;COVID-19, efficiency, procurers, Public procurement, regulation, suppliers;;"(2020) Report on the results of the expert and analytical event “Monitoring the development of the system of public and corporate procurement in the Russian Federation in 2019”, , [in Russian]; Baldi, S., Vannoni, D., The impact of centralization on pharmaceutical procurement prices: The role of institutional quality and corruption (2017) Regional Studies, 51 (3), pp. 426-438. , https://doi.org/10.1080/00343404.2015.1101517; Bawole, J.N., Adjei-Bamfo, P., Public procurement and public financial management in Africa: Dynamics and influences (2020) Public Organization Review, 20 (2), pp. 301-318. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11115-019-00443-7; Besley, T., (2006) Principled agents?

This is a subject that has not been investigated to a large extent yet, and especially when it comes to the situation in Greece, no relevant study could be found until recently, in spite of the particular importance of the issue to the Greek economy, as well as the Greek public sector. The issue under investigation is approached, on the one hand, through literature review, and on the other hand, through primary qualitative research. Finally, it was found that electronic public procurements are characterized by higher transparency compared to previous years and contribute to enabling access to new markets. However, it is not easy for Greek small and medium enterprises to have access to online tenders, while the relevant terminology and legal framework should be simplified. Further, it is necessary to make the tendering procedures shorter, since it is noticed that the procedures currently take 1.5–3 months more, compared to the previous regime. The mandatory implementation of the electronic platform of the National System of Electronic Public Procurements (E.S.I.DI.S.) was introduced through the legal provisions of Law 4412/2016. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Competition, Corruption, Decision making, E-procurement, Electronic public procurement, Exploitation, Greek public sector, Management, Public procurement, Resource saving, Simplification, Speed of transaction;;"Al-Aama, A., E-procurement vs. Online procurement: A means to increase transparency in a Saudi Government organisation: The case of the Jeddah Municipality (2012) International Journal of Procurement Management, 5, pp. 765-783; Albano, G.L., Antellini Russo, F., Castaldi, G., Zampino, R., Evaluating small busi-nesses’ performance in public e-procurement: Evidence from the Italian government’s e-marketplace (2015) Journal of Small Business Management, 53, pp. 229-250; Alvarez-Rodríguez, J.M., Labra-Gayo, J.E., de Pablos, P.O., New trends on e-Procurement applying semantic technologies: Current status and future challenges (2014) Computers in Industry, 65 (5), pp. 800-820; Alvarez-Rodríguez, J.M., Labra-Gayo, J.E., Rodriguez-Gonzalez, A., de Pablos, P.O., Empowering the access to public procurement opportunities by means of linking controlled vocabularies.

This paper aims to explore this vicious cycle hypothesis. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a survey of businesses registered with the procurement regulator in Honduras, a country with high grand corruption but low levels of administrative procurement corruption. The study uses the survey to test the effects of experiences and perceptions of corruption and personal connections on perceptions of fairness and intention to bid on future procurements. Findings: This study finds that experiences with bribery and the perceived importance of personal and party connections undermine perceptions of fairness, particularly for firms bidding with Honduras’s public works agency. While firms that have not bid recently view the process as less merit-based than those that have, the study does not find that perceptions of fairness influence intention to bid in the future as the vicious cycle hypothesis would suggest. Social implications: This research suggests that even firms that are frustrated with procurement irregularities are willing to tolerate them to access government markets. Originality/value: The study benefits from a unique survey of businesses on issues of corruption and connections in a challenging procurement environment. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Competition, Corruption, Honduras, Personal connections, Procurement;;"(2017) Informe de Línea Base: Secretaría de Infraestructura y Servicios Públicos, , Tegucigalpa, Honduras: Asociación para una Sociedad más Justa; (2017) Informe de Evaluación a la Secretaría de Salud, , Tegucigalpa: Asociación para una Sociedad más Justa; Bajari, P., Mcmillan, R., Tadelis, S., Auctions versus negotiations in procurement: an empirical analysis.

While the buyer faces the problem of creating the right attribute weights, the bidders have difficulty in adjusting the attribute values in each round. In this paper, we present an iterative multi-attribute reverse auction mechanism based on integrated data envelopment analysis (DEA) and best–worst method (BWM) with an objective of reducing the intervention of the buyer in the determination of the winner and also easing up the preference elicitation process. Unlike the typical scoring auctions, the proposed mechanism does not require the buyer to estimate the characteristics of the participating sellers in order to determine the optimal scoring function. As there will be no other intervention from the buyer during the winner determination process, the proposed method makes the procurement process impartial and corruption-free. Besides solving the buyer’s problem, the proposed mechanism is also associated with an optimal bid determination method (OBDM) to assist the sellers in formulating improvised bids in iterative rounds of the auction. Simulation experiments show that the proposed OBDM benefits both the buyer and sellers. For the buyer, it provides higher expected utility and attribute values as per his preferences; for the seller, it gives a better expected profit and a higher probability of winning. © World Scientific Publishing Co. & Operational Research Society of Singapore";Bid determination, data envelopment analysis, best–worst method, Public procurement, iterative multi-attribute reverse auction, Simulation, Winner determination;"Data envelopment analysis;

The present article draws on unique stakeholder interviews and document analysis to explore the evolving perceptions of corruption by Czech actors who had intimate knowledge of how this practice was occurring in the period between the last years of the communist regime until today. The key finding is that corruption in the Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic evolved from an individual coping strategy at the time of communism to a systemic phenomenon, which is widely institutionalized today, especially in the public procurement procedures. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.;;;"(1992) Svoboda a prosperita: Volební program ODS.

This paper critically explores the IP approach adopted in Thailand with a particular emphasis on the role of the Independent Observers (IOs). The objectives are threefold: to examine the arrangements of Thailand’s IP approach and the IOs; to identify the contribution of the IP approach to the prevention of corruption in Thailand’s public procurement; and to investigate fundamental challenges the IP approach and the IOs face. The findings demonstrate that the IP approach is an effective means for ensuring citizen engagement in exacting public accountability and prevention of corruption in public procurement. However, they also highlight the key challenges of effective implementation of the approach including politicization of the IOs, the exclusion of the IOs in the drafting of Terms of Reference (TOR) and the officials’ misconceptions about the IOs. © 2021 American Society for Public Administration.";civil society, corruption in public procurement, independent observers, Integrity Pact, social accountability;;"Ackerman, J., Co-governance for accountability: Beyond “exit” and “voice (2004) World Development, 32 (3), pp. 447-463; Artello, K., Albanese, S.J., Culture of corruption: Prosecutions, persistence, and desistence (2021) Public Integrity, pp. 1-20; Bovens, M., Schillemans, T., Hart, P., Does public accountability work?

It is impossible to effectively solve the problem of public expenditure without establishing a rational and transparent public procurement management system. These markets are an essential government function for the delivery of goods and services to citizens. The overall success of an automated public procurement function leads to progress and economic growth for the country. In this paper, we analyze the potential of blockchain technology to improve the efficiency, ease, and transparency of public procurement in the case of Morocco and identify the current challenges facing public procurement, namely the lack of trust and transparency among critical stakeholders in the procurement process. To solve these problems, we propose a blockchain-based infrastructure to improve the mechanism of public procurement. The use of this technology will reduce the time spent processing documentation, reduce the degree of corruption in the public procurement process, by creating reputation lists accessible to all participants. Also, the use of smart contracts makes it possible to minimize the number of intermediaries in the conclusion of public contracts. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Blockchain, Interoperability, Project-monitoring, Public procurement, Smart contracts;"Budget control; Contracts; Economics; Transparency; Delivery of goods; e-Procurement; Economic growths; Procurement process; Public contracts; Public expenditures; Public procurement; Public sector; Blockchain";"Zheng, Z., Xie, S., Dai, H., Chen, X., Wang, H.: An overview of blockchain technology: architecture, consensus, and future trends.

The lack of a clear definition of the limits of competence of participants in the budget process, discretionary powers in the distribution and expenditure of budget funds, conflicts in budget legislation, and the lack of real competition in the field of public procurement clearly form the main corruption risks for all participants in these legal relations. The purpose of the study was to analyse the international legal mechanisms for combating corruption and find ways to implement them in Ukrainian legislation. Enforcement of corruption crimes should be further strengthened at all levels. National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine should be provided with necessary resources, including more analytical capacity and better access to outside official experts. Methodological guidelines on most challenging and complicated issues need to be developed. International cooperation in corruption cases should be continued and further improved. And finally, court practice should be followed up to see what challenges will emerge at the stage of adjudication. © 2020 Estudios de Economia Aplicada.

To that end, it identifies and assesses the existing anti-bribery laws in Kuwait, including a legal evaluation based on international standards. This study raises several issues concerning the lack of regulations of private bribery, facilitating payments and kickbacks in government contracts, and gifts and hospitalities in private sector, using UK Bribery Act 2010 (UK BA 2010) as a reference. This study showcases how these legal shortcomings are inconsistent with international treaties, and undermine efforts to tackle corruption. Emphasis has been put on criminalising private bribery, regulating the acceptance of hospitalities and gifts and abolishing the commission payment regime in public contracts in Kuwait. Design/methodology/approach: Adopting a doctrinal focus, this paper examines case studies on curbing corporate bribery using both primary and secondary sources. Given the increasingly transitional and organised nature of business corruption, extravagant gifts and facilitating payments in public procurements globally, a comparison is drawn with the UK BA 2010. Findings: Kuwait’s legal system does not criminalise bribery in private sector. Its anti-bribery laws are not at par with international standards. Therefore, the laws on disclosing commissions in public contracts must be abolished, and facilitating payments and hospitality payments in private sector must be regulated. Originality/value: This study explores corporate criminal liability for bribery in Kuwait by investigating the weaknesses and legal shortcomings of the existing anti-bribery laws, and proposing reforms to counter these using UK BA 2010 as a guide. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Bribery, Corporate criminal liability, Corruption, Facilitating payment, Kickback, Kuwait;;"Alldridge, P., The U.K. Bribery act: ‘the caffeinated younger sibling of the FCPA’ (2012) Ohio State Law Journal, 73 (5), pp. 1181-1216; Al-Rashidi, K., (2021) Combating Corruption in the Middle East: A Social-Legal Study of Kuwait, , Routledge, London; Amico, A., Arab states as shareholders: origins and consequences (2017) Combining Economic and Political Development: The Experience of MENA, International Development Policy Series 7, pp. 114-131. , Luciani, G.

In the past decade, BOTs have experienced economic distress, political misdemeanours and rising perceptions of corruption. Lacking public procurement experience, how can these small, remote and socially unequal territories make the most of UK-led reforms? The article proposes inserting social award criteria in Caribbean BOTs' public procurement frameworks using a three-phase roadmap based on inspecting its potential, checking the legal framework and implementing the policy via legislative amendments and guidance. Experiences in the EU, the UK and the Latin America and Caribbean region show successful results, primarily in small communities at the local level. The methodology used is desk-based research leading to a worldwide survey of successful practices and a legal and policy analysis of its application to Caribbean BOTs.

Design/methodology/approach: This research adopted a case study methodology following a qualitative approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with government officers from Chile and New Zealand who had practice-relevant knowledge of public procurement and disaster management. Data was complemented by document reviews, including government reports and the records of disaster management organizations. Findings: This paper finds public procurement to be negatively affected by several factors during disasters, including celerity and flexibility of response; market and supplier restrictions; pressures over procurement teams; centralism of procurement structures; lack of technical knowledge; competition and crossover of agreements; corruption; and price variations. Practical implications: This paper includes policy recommendations on how to increase the effectiveness of disaster management and public procurement systems in countries at high risk of earthquakes and other disasters. Social implications: This paper can help public procurement officers to provide a better response during disasters, supplying the goods and services required to the affected population in a timely and effective manner. Originality/value: This paper addresses a gap in research by identifying factors which negatively impact government procurement and response during a disaster. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.";Chile, Disaster, Earthquake, Government, New Zealand, Public procurement;;"Angel, J., McCabe, D., The ethics of speculation (2009) Journal of Business Ethics, 90, pp. 277-286; Arrowsmith, S., Treumer, S., Fejø, J., Jiang, L., (2010) Public Procurement Regulation: An Introduction, , University of Nottingham, UK; Atkinson, C., Sapat, A., After Katrina: comparisons of post-disaster public procurement approaches and outcomes in the New Orleans area (2012) Journal of Public Procurement, 12 (3), pp. 356-385; Babbie, E.R., (2004) The Practice of Social Research, , Wadsworth Publishing Co Inc., Belmont, CA; Balcik, B., Beamon, B., Krejci, C., Muramatsu, K., Ramirez, M., Coordination in humanitarian relief chains: practices, challenges and opportunities (2010) International Journal of Production Economics, 126 (1), pp. 22-34; (2017) Quienes somos, , www.chilecompra.cl/que-es-chilecompra/, (accessed, About us: 23 June 2017; Cousins, P., Lamming, R., Lawson, B., Squire, B., (2008) Strategic Supply Management: Principles, Theories and Practice, , Prentice Hall/Financial Times, UK; Criss, R.M., Strategic sourcing in an emergency contracting environment (2006) Journal of Contract Management, 46 (1), pp. 12-17; Denzin, N., (1989) The Research Act: A Theoretical Introduction to Sociological Methods, , 3rd ed., Prentice Hall Inc; Frankfort-Nachmias, C., Nachmias, D., (1996) Research Methods in the Social Sciences, , 5th ed., London Arnold; Goya, F., (2015) Shaping a procurement plan for emergencies, , http://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/shaping-procurement-plan-emergencies, (accessed, The World Bank website: 6 May 2017; Harink, J.H.A., (1999) Excelling with E-Procurement: The Electronic Highway to Competitive Advantage, , Alphen aan den Rijin, Holland: Samson; Kaatrud, D., Samii, R., Van Wassenhove, L.N., UN joint logistics center: a coordinated response to common humanitarian logistics concerns (2003) Forced Migration Review, 18, pp. 11-14; Kovács, G., Spens, K.M., Humanitarian logistics in disaster relief operations (2007) International Journal of Physical Distribution and Logistics Management, 37 (2), pp. 99-114; Le Masurier, J., Wilkinson, S., Shestakova, Y., An analysis of the alliancing procurement method for reconstruction following an earthquake (2006) 8th US National Conference on Earthquake Engineering, , San Francisco, CA: 18-22 of April 2006; (2017) New Zealand government procurement, , www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/nz-govt-procurement-and-property/about-nz-govt-procurement, (accessed, New Zealand Government – Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Website: 23 June 2017; Newman, D., (2005) Procurement’s role in an emergency or disaster.

This scourge impedes government departments capacity to render public services effectively and efficiently. South African public administration is confronted by multiple obstacles such as the lack of transparency, accountability and efficiency. Government public procurement systems have become a breeding ground for corruption and maladministration. This article argues that a central neglected factor is failure to adhere to sound ethical conduct in the execution of public duties despite numerous government training and development initiatives in this regard in the public sector. Arguably, the new dispensation under the current leadership of President Ramaphosa needs to overhaul the functioning of public organisation, implement sound whistle blowing mechanisms to inhibit corruption and encourage public managers to observe good ethical conduct when serving the public. The implications of this study, therefore, accentuate good principles of governance which includes transparency, accountability and ethics, which are the key determinants for effective public service delivery.

N° 395, stipulates that the acquisition of goods and services in the Autonomous Decentralized Parochial Governments must be carried out through the public procurement portal since these processes must be supervised and transparent by the control bodies to demonstrate the use of public resources, being considered a very sensitive procedure in the sense that this is one of the means of tax fraud, Therefore, this research contains a comparative study of the public procurement processes carried out in the Autonomous Decentralized Rural Parochial Governments of Intag, based on the application of current regulations, in which it is determined that goods and services must be acquired through the public procurement portal for the benefit of the population according to the needs and budgeted by public sector entities. The research methodology is descriptive and reflective, it contains information collected from the Parish GADs from an analytical and interpretative perspective, its results determine compliance with regulations and possible causes that influence when executing the processes established by public procurement. © 2021, University of Cienfuegos, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

The application of the Historical-Logical research method has allowed to know how internal control has evolved in the organizational performance, and its great importance for the achievement of the institutional objectives. The absence of control actions aimed at evaluating the processes developed by public entities, mostly corresponds to situations generated by attending to interests; concluding that it is necessary to implement control actions as strategies that contribute to avoid situations of risk, fraud, and corruption in the management of public affairs. © 2021, University of Cienfuegos, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

Due to the limited participation in the auction processes, detection of anticompetitive agreements was possible. The econometric analysis used in our study supported the findings of a cartel agreement. Cluster analysis, statistical hypothesis, normality and symmetry and nonparametric tests reveal two types of auctions: competitive and noncompetitive bids. The aim of this paper is to analyze the public procurement auctions with nonparametric statistical methods. Our findings are in line with the literature in the field.

Design/methodology/approach: An outcome-based dynamic performance management approach is adopted to explore a representative case study of a small Italian municipality. The model is based on three sources: qualitative primary data generated by face-to-face convergent interviews; secondary data retrieved from documents describing legal cases linked to procurement and open-access repositories; and an extensive literature review. Findings: Emphasizing the role of community civic morality systemically may help to understand some counterintuitive results in the past research and support decision-makers and policymakers in setting effective strategies to curb the associated negative implications. Social implications: A dynamic approach of performance management aimed at framing corruption in public procurement may guide policymakers and decision-makers in keeping their “cognitive radar” constantly active, in a way to detect emerging corruptive phenomena that could be otherwise ignored by normal diagnostical approaches. It may also help to promote organizational ethical learning and improve community outcomes. Originality/value: This research provides a causal and systemic framework of relationships involving local government performance and wrongdoings in public procurement, by including performance risk indicators linked to structural and individualistic causes of corruption. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.";Community outcomes, Control systems, Corruption, DPM, Dynamic performance management, Financial distress, Local government, P&C, Planning systems, Small municipality;;"Anthony, R., Selection of a framework (1965) Planning and Control Systems: A Framework for Analysis, pp. 1-23. , Division of Research, Harvard Business School, Boston, MA; Bandiera, O., Prat, A., Valletti, T., Active and passive waste in government spending: evidence from a policy experiment (2009) American Economic Review, 99 (4), pp. 1278-1308; Basheka, B.C., Public procurement corruption and its implications on effective service delivery in Uganda: an empirical study (2009) International Journal of Procurement Management, 2 (4), pp. 415-440; Basheka, B.C., Oluka, P.N., Karyeija, G.K., The nature and forms of public procurement corruption in Uganda's local government systems: implications for good governance debate (2013) International Journal of Procurement Management, 6 (6), pp. 684-701; Bauhr, M., Grimes, M., Indignation or resignation: the implications of transparency for societal accountability (2014) Governance, 27 (2), pp. 291-320; Bianchi, C., (2016) Dynamic Performance Management, , Springer International Publishing, Switzerland; Bianchi, C., Bovaird, T., Loeffler, E., Applying a dynamic performance management framework to wicked issues: how coproduction helps to transform young people’s services in surrey county council, UK (2017) International Journal of Public Administration, 40 (10), pp. 833-846; Bianchi, C., Cosenz, F., Marinković, M., Designing dynamic performance management systems to foster SME competitiveness according to a sustainable development perspective.

Currently, the RF is actively developing market relations and market principles of procurement; the planned economy and the command-administrative relations which regulated it have already been left in the distant past. In the context of Russia’s economic development and financial stability, it was necessary to create a quality mechanism for distributing and regulating trade in the country. In this case, an effective “tool” was the contract procurement system with all its components, which allowed the national economy to reach a new modern level of development. The rapid development of digital technologies in the world leads to an intensive transformation of the entire system of public relations. The technological changes also require greater flexibility in the procurement system. Now we can see how the traditional methods of conducting the procurement procedures are increasingly taking a back seat, giving way to the electronic procurement procedures. Under the influence of these processes, the system of public procurement in the Eurasian Economic Union began to develop. The purpose of the work: to study the characteristics, value, the positive aspects of the methods of selecting the executors of the order by e-environment in the contract procurement system of Russia, the state procurement of economic entities in the countries of the EAEU, the information support of the contract procurement system in Russia and the EAEU countries; to identify the existing problems in the contract purchasing system on the EAEU market; to study and adopt the foreign experience in electronic procurement. Methods: the methods of systematicity, analysis, and comparative law are used. Results: the authors’ well-founded position is based on the legislation and the opinion of the scientific community on the current opportunities for electronic and information support of the contract procurement system in the EAEU. For a systematic and practical update of the legal rules governing the electronic procurement procedures, as well as the overall unified procurement information system, it is necessary to create an initial legislative base from which in the future, it would be possible to start, change and supplement it, adhering to a gradual approach, rather than a cardinal one. The international experience in the implementation of public procurement in various countries shows the missing points in the Russian contract system, as well as provides for the introduction of new methods and approaches to the organization of relations in public procurement in the EAEU countries. Conclusion: the existence of a unified procurement information system, electronic platforms, and electronic procurement undoubtedly contain a number of positive aspects: the level of competition increases, the price to be paid from the budget is lower, the interference in the relevant procedures of the commission members is reduced, the corruption risks and the risk of collusion are drastically reduced, and the entire procurement process is more transparent. Public procurement is an important part of the economic structure of the EEU member states. In this regard, it is necessary to remove the obstacles in the internal market of the union. There are a number of issues and areas that the countries still need to work on. At the same time, the experience of foreign countries and the EU countries considered by the authors in the paper is very tempting, but it is not necessary to blindly adopt all the possibilities of the world’s electronic and information procurement systems. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.";Contract system, Customer, Digital services, Electronic procurement procedures, Public procurement, The EAEU countries;;"The Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union Dated 29.05.2014.

With the development of IT technology and thus the digitization of the Public Procurement Process (PPP), the amount of available data is increasing. Studies have shown progress in this area and have revealed many challenges and open issues geared to the various goals outlined in this paper. Different data mining and business intelligence techniques and methods are being used to develop models that will find any suspicious public procurement process, contracts, economic operators, or to classify observations as corrupt. In addition to using classification models, methods such as association rules and graph databases are used to find relationships between economic operators and contracting authorities, as well as to find daughter companies that participate in PPP collusion. Therefore, this paper addresses a comprehensive review of the emerging techniques and models used for the detection of suspicious or corrupted observations, their goals, open issues, challenges, methods and metrics used, tools, and relevant data sources. The findings show that models are mostly fitted on historical data and move in the direction of an early warning system. Moreover, the efficiency of fraud or anomaly detection depends on data set quality and detection of the most important red flags. The study is presenting a summary of identified fraud detection model objectives such as predicting fraud risk in contracts and contractors or finding split purchases, and detection of used data sources such as public procurement process or economic operator data. © 2021.

This research was conducted empirically by involving 265 respondents from accountants, stakeholders, civil servants and inspectors in Central Java, Indonesia who were analyzed by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with AMOS analysis tools. The theoretical test results confirm the fraud triangle and the theory of planned behavior to study the opportunity and financial process factors and the rationalization factor which emphasizes the moral psychological aspects. In practical terms, these findings underline the need for tiered supervision in the implementation of goods and services procurement projects in the public sector, improve the quality of reporting and accounting systems, and improve individual integrity to carry out work. Also, it is necessary to increase the remuneration of employees and provide competitive pricing for the private sector involved in procurement projects to minimize intentions for corruption and corrupt behavior by improving the quality of life of the individuals involved in supervision, auditing and reporting. © 2021, Growing Science.

In procurement, the government agency faces a tradeoff between the expected allocative efficiency and the expected rent paid to the contracting firm. When the government agency's efficiency gain is larger (resp. smaller) than its rent loss, it is optimal for the government agency to choose the contract with the low-cost (resp. high-cost) firm. The general public usually deems that the latter case implies that there exists favoritism in public procurement. We point out that such seeming favoritism is not favoritism in the true sense. There may be an over-identification of favoritism in public procurement in the existing literature. © 2020 The University of Manchester and John Wiley & Sons Ltd;favoritism, limited liability, moral hazard, public procurement;;"Asker, J., Cantillon, E., Properties of scoring auctions (2008) RAND Journal of Economics, 39, pp. 69-85. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-2171.2008.00004.x; Asker, J., Cantillon, E., Procurement when price and quality matter (2010) RAND Journal of Economics, 41, pp. 1-34. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-2171.2009.00088.x; Branco, F., Procurement favoritism and technology adoption (2002) European Economic Review, 46, pp. 73-91; Büchner, S., Freytag, A., González, L.G., Güth, W., Bribery and public procurement: An experimental study (2008) Public Choice, 37, pp. 103-117. , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-008-9315-9; Burguet, R., Che, Y.-K., Competitive procurement with corruption (2004) RAND Journal of Economics, 35, pp. 50-68. , https://doi.org/10.2307/1593729; Celentani, M., Ganuza, J.-J., Corruption and competition in procurement (2002) European Economic Review, 46, pp. 1273-1303. , https://doi.org/10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00147-7; Che, Y.-K., Design competition through multidimensional auctions (1993) RAND Journal of Economics, 24, pp. 668-680. , https://doi.org/10.2307/2555752; Che, Y.-K., Procurement (2008) The new Palgrave dictionary of economics, 6, pp. 657-662. , S.

Our results also indicate that the effect is persistent after six years, and is not influenced by the coexistence of other organizational models, such as amalgamation and hybrid systems. Finally, we document that the reduction in public expenditure is effective only in areas characterized by poor quality of institutions, indicating that procurement centralization might be an effective tool to reduce corruption-related inefficiencies in the health sector. © 2020 The Authors;Healthcare public expenditure, Purchase centralization, Quality of institutions;;"Albano, G.L., Sparro, M., Flexible strategies for centralized public procurement (2010) Review of Economics and Institutions, 1 (2); Albornotz, F., Cabrales, A., Decentralization, political competition and corruption (2013) J.

With the proliferation of e-procurement systems in the public sector, anti-corruption agencies and watchdog organizations have access to valuable sources of information with which to identify transactions that are likely to become troublesome and why. In this article, we discuss the promises and challenges of using machine learning models to predict inefficiency and corruption in public procurement. We illustrate this approach with a dataset with more than two million public procurement contracts in Colombia. We trained machine learning models to predict which of them will result in corruption investigations, a breach of contract, or implementation inefficiencies. We then discuss how our models can help practitioners better understand the drivers of corruption and inefficiency in public procurement. Our approach will be useful to governments interested in exploiting large administrative datasets to improve the provision of public goods, and it highlights some of the tradeoffs and challenges that they might face throughout this process. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters;Corruption, Forecasting, Inefficiency, Machine learning, Public procurement;;"Acevedo, K.M., Bornacelly, I.D., Panel municipal del CEDE (2014), Universidad de los Andes-CEDE; Ades, A., Tella, R.D., Rents, competition and corruption (1999) American Economic Review, 89 (4), pp. 982-993; Adsera, A., Boix, C., Payne, M., Are you being served?

It is estimated that between 2% and 5% of the global GDP is lost annually because of such practices, not only directly impacting public services and private sector development but also strengthening organized crime. However, most law enforcement agencies do not have the capability to carry out systematic corruption risk assessment leveraging on the availability of data related to public procurement. The currently prevailing approach employed by Brazilian law enforcement agencies to detect companies involved in potential cases of fraud consists in receiving circumstantial evidence or complaints from whistleblowers. As a result, a large number of companies involved in fraud remain undetected and unprosecuted. The decision support system (DSS) described in this work addresses these existing limitations by providing a tool for systematic analysis of public procurement. It allows the law enforcement agencies to establish priorities concerning the companies to be investigated. This DSS incorporates data mining algorithms for quantifying dozens of corruption risk patterns for all public contractors inside a specific jurisdiction, leading to improvements in the quality of public spending and to the identification of more cases of fraud. These algorithms combine operations research tools such as graph theory, clusterization, and regression analysis with advanced data science methods to allow the identification of the main risk patterns, such as collusion between bidders, conflicts of interest (e.g., a politician who owns a company contracted by the same government body where he or she was elected), and companies owned by a potentially straw person used for disguising its real owner (e.g., beneficiaries of cash conditional transfer programs). The DSS has already led to a detailed analysis of large public procurement datasets, which add up to more than 50 billion dollars. Moreover, the DSS provided strategic inputs to investigations conducted by federal and state agencies. © 2020 The Authors.

This has motivated entities to promote anti-corruption strategies, most of these strategies are manual and social in nature. In order to effectively (efficiently and efficiently) predict and detect corruption, it is necessary to carry out automatic processes. This review seeks to establish the fundamental concepts of the state of the art related to solutions that apply anti-corruption strategies and based on this, analyze the feasibility of creating a model for detecting and identifying corruption in the public procurement process. The results show that combining statistical techniques with information technologies (artificial intelligence, big data, data mining, among others) is a promising line of research in this area of application. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop specific automatic models for the detection of the different crimes of corruption in contracting. © 2020, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

However, there is little evidence on precisely how to control corruption in development aid. This article assesses under which conditions donor regulations are successful in controlling corruption in aid spent by national governments through procurement tenders. The article analyses data on donor-funded procurement contracts in 100+ countries in 1998–2008 and uses ‘single bid submitted in a competitive tender’ as a corruption risk indicator. Applying a contract-level propensity score matching and regression analysis, it finds that an intervention which increases donor oversight and widens access to tenders is effective in reducing corruption risks: lowering single bidding on competitive markets by 3.6–4.3 percentage points. This effect is greater in countries with low-state capacity. © 2020, The Author(s).;Corruption, Development aid, Party systems, Public procurement, State capacity;"aid dependency; aid policy; corruption; development aid; governance approach; party politics; regulatory framework; risk assessment; state role; Indicator indicator";"Alesina, A., Weder, B., Do corrupt governments receive less foreign aid?

While scandals suggest such practices are relatively widespread, the extent of such partisan favoritism is difficult to measure and the conditions under which it flourishes under-theorized. Drawing on theory regarding the role of institutions as constraints on corruption, we identify three spheres of political influence over government contracting and show how elites can manipulate two of those spheres to increase their opportunities to influence the procurement process and minimize external accountability, facilitating the corrupt allocation of contracts to partisan allies. Using an innovative big data methodology, we then identify the effects of a change in government on procurement markets in two countries, Hungary and the United Kingdom, which differ in terms of political influence over these institutions. We find that politically-favored companies secure 50–60% of the central government contracting market in Hungary but only 10% in the UK. © 2019, The Author(s).;Clientelism, Corruption measurement, Governance, Grand corruption, Public procurement;;"Anderson, B., Cacique democracy and the Philippines: Origins and dreams (1988) New Left Review, (169), p. 3; Auriol, E., Flochel, T., Straub, S., (2011) Public Procurement and Rent-Seeking: The Case of Paraguay, , (TSE Working Papers No. 11–224).

In Indonesia, there are seven types of corruption cases handled by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). One of the corruption cases which is detrimental to the state occurs in public procurement, such as the procurement of goods/services. This case is the second most corrupt crime after bribery in Indonesia. In this research, wetry to identify potential corruption from auction data on goods/services procurement in government. By using Big Data technology, it is expected that the process can be carried out immediately to assist the KPK in identifying potential corruption in goods/services procurement auctions. © 2020 IEEE.;Big Data, Corruption, Machine Learning;"Developing countries; Data technologies; Good governances; Indonesia; Procurement auction; Public procurement; Crime";"Sabani, A., Farah, M.H., Sari Dewi, D.R., Indonesia in the spotlight: Combating corruption through ICT enabled governance (2019) Procedia Computer Science; (2019) Statistik TPK Berdasarkan Jenis Perkara Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi, , http://www.kpk.go.id/id/statistik/penindakan/tpk-berdasarkan-jenisperkara., Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi, [Accessed: 18-Apr-2020]; (2015) The World Bank, Benchmarking Public Procurement 2016: Assessing Public Procurement Systems in 77 Economies, , The World Bank; (2018) Report to the Nations-Global Study on Occupational Fraud and Abuse: Asia Pacific, , http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2222608, ACFE, Asia Pacific Ed; Huda, S.N., Setiani, N., Pulungan, R., Winarko, E., Potential fraudulent behaviors in e-procurement implementation in Indonesia (2017) IOP Conf.

Using Bicol University's three-year procurement data as a sample, this paper explores the use of process mining on publicly-Available procurement data to discover underlying structure of procurement processes of government entities in the Philippines, check for conformance with the prescribed process in the procurement law, and identify potentially problematic nodes. In this paper, event logs were generated from official public procurement data and mined with heuristics-based process mining algorithm, using free, open-sourced tools. The discovered processes revealed a concept drift in publication of contract award, a point for inspection and improvement for the agencies involved. © 2020 IEEE.;Business process, Conformance checking, Process mining, Procurement;"Contracts; Quality of service; Social networking (online); Business Process; Concept drifts; Contract award; Government entities; Philippines; Process mining; Procurement process; Public procurement; Data mining";"(2007) Integrity in Public Procurement: Good Practice from A to Z, Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, OECD, Paris; Government Procurement Reform Act Implementing Rules and Regulations (2016) Government Procurement Policy Board, , https://www.gppb.gov.ph/laws/laws/RevisedIRR.RA9184.pdf; Pilippine Government EProcurement System Official Web Portal (2019) Department of Budget and Management, , https://www.philgeps.gov.ph/; Aalst Der Van, P.W.M., (2011) Process Mining: Discovery, Conformance and Enhancement of Business Process, , Springer; Grossman, W., Rinderle-Ma, S., Process Mining"" in (2015) Fundamentals of Business Intelligence, , Springer; Weijters, A.J.M.M., Der Aalst, W., Medeiros, A.K.K., (2016) Process Mining with the Heuristics Miner-Algorithm; Sangil, M.J., Exploratory Data Analysis of Government Procurement Data to Influence Bidding Decision and Strategy in Albay, Philippines, , Manuscript Submitted for Publication; Weijters, A.J.M.M., Der Aalst, W., Medeiros, A.K.K., (2016) Process Mining with the Heuristics Miner-Algorithm; (2020) Government Procurement Policy Board Gppb Recognized Trainers, , https://www.gppb.gov.ph/recognized-Trainers.php, Accessed on April 18; DBM-GPPB, Partner State Universities ink MOA for Certified Public Procurement Specialist Course (2017) Department of Budget and Management, , https://www.dbm.gov.ph/index.php/secretary-scorner/press-releases/list-of-press-releases/338-dbm-gppb-partnerstate-universities-ink-moa-for-certified-public-procurementspecialist-course, Oct. 25 Accessed on: Apr. 17, 2020; Weijters, A.J.M.M., Der Aalst, W., Medeiros, A.K.K., (2016) Process Mining with the Heuristics Miner-Algorithm; (2020) The R Foundation the R Project for Statistical Computing, , https://www.rproject.org/, Accessed on August 13; (2020) Process Mining Group Eindhoven, , http://www.promtools.org/doku.php, Technical University ProM Tools Accessed on August 13; Mannhardt, F., Tax, N., Schunselaar, D.M.M., Convert CSV to XES Module ProM Workbench; Verbeek, H.M.W., Filter Log Using Simple Heuristics ProM Workbench; Claes, J., Add Artificial Events ProM Workbench; Weijters, A.J.M.M., Heuristics Miner Module ProM Workbench; Bigornia, J., (2020) Face to Face Interview, , January 15; Bids, L., Committee, A., Layertech, H., City 2-day Freedom of Information on Open Contracting Dialogues with Speakers from Presidential Communications Office (2018) Government Procurement Policy Board and National Privacy Commission, , August 3-4; Sangil, M.J., Maceda, L., OCDex Portal: A data-driven approach in analyzing procurement process of community-based HIV/AIDS advocacy related items Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Machine Learning and Soft Computing January 17-19, 2020, Haiphong.

It extends the agency cost-padding model by Laffont and Tirole (1992) to allow for the principal to be a partially selfish politician who can design the contract auditing policy. It is found that a benevolent politician, by choosing a sufficiently strict auditing, deters the contracting firm from padding costs; conversely, a selfish politician chooses a relatively lax auditing in order to create an incentive for cost-padding, and engages in corruption with the firm in case of detection. If the cost of auditing is high enough, even a benevolent politician might prefer to allow cost-padding. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.";Corruption in procurement, Cost-padding, Endogenous auditing, Principal-agent model, Procurement contracts, Selfish politician;;"Acemoglu, D., Institutions, factor prices, and taxation: Virtues of strong states?

Mélon L., Spruk R.;"57194484719;55532098500;";The impact of e-procurement on institutional quality;2020;Journal of Public Procurement;20;4;;333;375;;1;10.1108/JOPP-07-2019-0050;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086447015&doi=10.1108%2fJOPP-07-2019-0050&partnerID=40&md5=a68964947c98623cc39a17cd55af6357;Purpose: Because of the renewed interest in public purchasing and the strategic use of public funds under the requirements of sustainable development, the question arose once again as to how to curb the fall of institutional quality once criteria other than price are inserted into the decision-making in public purchasing. E-procurement has been repeatedly named as one of the most efficient tools to that effect and the present paper sets out to discover whether the implementation of e-procurement in a particular country per se entails also higher institutional quality, allowing for a wider implementation of green and sustainable procurement at the national, regional and municipal level without the fear of worsening the country’s institutional quality. By analyzing the implementation of e-procurement in Denmark, the Netherlands and in Portugal, this paper aims to verify the hypothesis that the implementation of e-procurement implies better institutions in terms of public purchasing. As such, the conclusions will be used in further research on the prerequisites for a successful implementation of green public procurement across the European Union. Design/methodology/approach: Gathering data on institutional quality of three early e-procurement adopters (Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal) allows for comparison of institutional quality pre- and post-e-procurement implementation. By using difference-in-differences comparison the paper seeks to answer the question how doesmandatory e-procurement influence institutional quality on the national level. Findings: The paper finds that the reform is generally associated with a relatively stronger control of corruption in the Netherlands and Denmark, while a similar reform in Portugal failed to translate into a stronger control of corruption. Furthermore, while using the quality of regulation as a dependent variable, a positive and robust effect on the quality of regulation in Denmark was shown, while the quality of reputation in the Netherlands and Portugal declined in the post-reform period, with the drop in the quality of regulation in Portugal being considerably greater, a two-fold higher amount than the estimated drop in the Netherlands. The paper suggests that in spite of the same aims, the reform yielded substantially different or even opposing effects compared to Denmark. Research limitations/implications: By examining three examples of early adopters, further research with broader impact is needed to deduce general implications for e-procurement implementation. Furthermore, implementation of e-procurement at the regional or local level can also yield distinct results. Social implications: Understanding the actual impact of e-procurement on institutional quality is indispensable for further study on the matter. The present study argues that e-procurement needs to be accompanied by additional measures or variables to yield a positive impact on institutional quality in public procurement. Originality/value: As to originality, the present paper uses a law and economics approach, originating or better said drawing motivation from green public procurement concerns, trying to provide an insight in terms of tools that can be used to eliminate concerns regarding institutional quality when implementing green public procurement practices. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.;E-procurement, Institutional quality, Public procurement;;"Abadie, A., Diamond, A., Hainmueller, J., Synthetic control methods for comparative case studies: estimating the effect of California’s tobacco control program (2010) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 105 (490), pp. 493-505; Abadie, A., Diamond, A., Hainmueller, J., Comparative politics and the synthetic control method (2015) American Journal of Political Science, 59 (2), pp. 495-510; Abadie, A., Gardeazabal, J., The economic costs of conflict: a case study of the Basque country (2003) American Economic Review, 93 (1), pp. 113-132; Acemoglu, D., Egorov, G., Sonin, K., Political selection and persistence of bad governments (2010) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 125 (4), pp. 1511-1575; Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., Unbundling institutions (2005) Journal of Political Economy, 113 (5), pp. 949-995; Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., Robinson, J., Thaicharoen, Y., Institutional causes, macroeconomic symptoms: volatility, crises and growth (2003) Journal of Monetary Economics, 50 (1), pp. 49-123; Acemoglu, D., Robinson, J.A., De facto political power and institutional persistence (2006) American Economic Review, 96 (2), pp. 325-330; Adhikari, B., Alm, J., Evaluating the economic effects of flat tax reforms using synthetic control methods (2016) Southern Economic Journal, 83 (2), pp. 437-463; Aghion, P., Tirole, J., Formal and real authority in organizations (1997) Journal of Political Economy, 105 (1), pp. 1-29; Aguiar Costa, L., Arantes, A., Valadares Tavares, L., Evidence of the impacts of public procurement: the Portuguese experience (2013) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 19 (4), pp. 238-246; Alonso, R., Matouschek, N., Optimal delegation (2008) Review of Economic Studies, 75 (1), pp. 259-293; Andersen, T.B., E-government as an anti-corruption strategy (2009) Information Economics and Policy, 21 (3), pp. 201-210; Arellano, M., Bond, S., Some tests of specification for panel data: Monte Carlo evidence and an application to employment equations (1991) The Review of Economic Studies, 58 (2), pp. 277-297; Auriol, E., Corruption in procurement and public purchase (2006) International Journal of Industrial Organization, 24 (5), pp. 867-885; Auriol, E., Straub, S., Flochel, T., Public procurement and rent-seeking: the case of Paraguay (2016) World Development, 77, pp. 395-407; Bajari, P., McMillan, R., Tadelis, S., Auctions versus negotiations in procurement: an empirical analysis (2008) The Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 25 (2), pp. 372-399; Baldi, S., Vannoni, D., The impact of centralization on pharmaceutical procurement prices: the role of institutional quality and corruption (2017) Regional Studies, 51 (3), pp. 426-438; Bandiera, O., Prat, A., Valletti, T., Active and passive waste in government spending: evidence from a policy experiment (2009) American Economic Review, 99 (4), pp. 1278-1308; Banerjee, A.V., Duflo, E., Reputation effects and the limits of contracting: a study of the Indian software industry (2000) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 115 (3), pp. 989-1017; Ben-Michael, E., Feller, A., Rothstein, J., (2018) The augmented synthetic control method, , Working Paper, University of California, Berkeley; Bertrand, M., Duflo, E., Mullainathan, S., How much should we trust differences-in-differences estimates?

This research aims to improve the E-Tendering Electronic Procurement System (EPS) to be more transparent, accountable, and effective in preventing corruption and support the Corruption Eradication Commission (CEC). Management Information System and Business Process Reengineering methods are used in this study. The information system design proposed in this research made with a structured system development method consists of 4 stages; the creation of entity-relationship diagrams (ERD), relational database, use case diagram, and data flow diagram (DFD). This research provides three choices of scenarios that are modeled and simulated by iGrafx software. The most realistic scenario to be implemented right now is the first scenario with database integration for government agencies' administrative documents. The first scenario's benefit is reducing average cycle time by 34.20%, faster bid evaluation process, and eliminating face-to-face processes to prevent collusion. Scenario 3 is the ideal scenario to be implemented in a long-term project. The third scenario's benefit is reducing average cycle time by 18.34%, a faster bid evaluation process, eliminating face-to-face processes to prevent collusion, strengthening E-Tendering supervision with Self Monitoring, Analysis, Reporting Technology (SMART), and increase information transparency. © 2020 IEEE.";Business Process Reengineering, Corruption Prevention and Eradication, E-Tendering, Management Information Systems, Public Procurement Corruption;"Crime; Data flow graphs; Electronic data interchange; Information use; Purchasing; Reengineering; Business process re-engineering; Database integration; Electronic procurement systems; Entity relationship diagrams; Government agencies; Information transparency; Realistic scenario; Relational Database; Information management";"(2017) Transparency International Indonesia, Indeks Persepsi Korupsi Indonesia 2017: Survei Antara Pelaku Usaha di 12 Kota di Indonesia.; (2019) Statistik TPK Berdasarkan Jenis Perkara, , https://www.kpk.go.id/id/statistik/penindakan/tpkberdasarkan-jenis-perkara; Xinli, H., Effectiveness of information technology in reducing corruption in China a validation of the delone and mclean information systems success model (2015) Electron.

A perception of the potential for corruption and waste of public resources has been met with calls for transparency and accountability. Competition is believed to lead to impartial, optimal outcomes, but attention paid to competition in the literature suggests that the benefits are not universally clear. This paper considers ‘full and open competition’ as a policy promise, ethical obligation, and a matter of justice, drawing upon work of John Rawls and others, in the United States case. The research question is: What do Federal procurement data tell us about the nature of full and open competition in practice? This study draws upon contract data available from the U.S. Federal government, for fiscal years from 2015 to 2018. Through an ordinal regression, it is suggested that variation in the extent of competition results in part from size of project, size of the business (or potential business) receiving the project, and the industry classification, particularly in cases centering on commercial acquisitions. While ‘full and open competition’ is frequently employed, the difference between the normative value of the concept in statute, and practical outcomes in implementation, is clear. This difference has consequences for both vendors and the government. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;acquisitions, competition, fairness, justice, Public procurement, United States;;"Adjei-Bamfo, P., Maloreh-Nyamekye, T., Ahenkan, A., The role of e-government in sustainable public procurement in developing countries: A systematic literature review (2019) Resources, Conservation & Recycling, 142, pp. 189-203; Albano, G.L., Cesi, B., Iozzi, A., Public procurement with unverifiable quality: The case for discriminatory competitive procedures (2017) Journal of Public Economics, 145, pp. 14-26; Amey, S.H., Contract design failures lead to bad deals (2012) Public Administration Review, 72 (5), pp. 697-698; Berrios, R., Government contracts and contractor behavior (2006) Journal of Business Ethics, 63, pp. 119-130; Boylan, J., After Katrina: Is the emergency exception to public bidding all washed up?

The methodology proposes asking counterparts about attitudes toward some behaviors of agents, which are undesirable from the principal and benevolent counterpart perspective. The approach identifies the potential opportunism of counterparts based on the intensity with which they justify such behavior and provide unrealistic assessments of commonly known problems. The approach is especially important in a situation where the rules are inconsistent with reality and the principal can no longer disentangle the benevolent and opportunistic behavior of the agent. The authors test this approach by conducting a survey of procurers and suppliers of public procurement contracts in Russia. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;corruption, opportunism, procurer, Public procurement, supplier;;"Agaba, E., Shipman, N., Public procurement reform in developing countries: The Ugandan experience (2007) Advancing Public Procurement: Practices, Innovation and Knowledge-Sharing, 2 (4), pp. 373-391; Bandiera, O., Prat, A., Valletti, T., Active and passive waste in government spending: Evidence from a policy experiment (2009) American Economic Review, 99 (4), pp. 1278-1308; Bergen, M., Dutta, S., Walker, O.C., Jr., Agency relationships in marketing: A review of the implications and applications of agency and related theories (1992) Journal of Marketing, 56 (3), pp. 1-24; Bhattacharya, A., Singh, P.J., Nand, A.A., Antecedents of buyer opportunistic behavior in outsourcing relationships (2015) International Journal of Production Economics, 166, pp. 258-268; Calzolari, G., Spagnolo, G., (2009) Relational contracts and competitive screening, , London: Centre for Economic Policy Research; Chen, C.C., Peng, M.W., Saparito, P.A., Individualism, collectivism, and opportunism: A cultural perspective on transaction cost economics (2002) Journal of Management, 28 (4), pp. 567-583; Crocker, K.J., Reynolds, K.J., The efficiency of incomplete contracts: An empirical analysis of air force engine procurement (1993) The RAND Journal of Economics, 24, pp. 126-146; Crosno, J.L., Dahlstrom, R., A meta-analytic review of opportunism in exchange relationships (2008) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 36 (2), pp. 191-201; Darby, M.R., Karni, E., Free competition and the optimal amount of fraud (1973) The Journal of Law and Economics, 16 (1), pp. 67-88; De Soto, H., (1989) The other path: The invisible revolution in the third world, , New York, NY: HarperCollins. 2nd ed., retitled, The other path: The economic answer to terrorism,.

Using information from the Electronic Public Procurement System (SECOP), the determinants of the probability of an addition to a contract are identified. The errors of the government can be interpreted as an approximation of their corruption. The average income and educational level of a colombian department are found to directly influence the probability of an addition. Using the estimation of the binary choice models, the forecast error of an addition is estimated, it is found that public and civil works contracts have more forecast error, forming an ideal mechanism for thefts and accumulation of bribes. Our results show that predicting an addition can be done with high certainty. © 2020 The Author(s)Corruption, Government, Binary Choice; Economics; Behavioral economics; Economic Development; Microeconomics; Econometrics © 2020 The Author(s)";Behavioral economics, Binary choice, Corruption, Econometrics, Economic development, Economics, Government, Microeconomics;;"Ades, A., Di Tella, R., Rents, competition, and corruption (1999) Am.

Our results reveal that Mafia infiltration is positively associated with number of submitted bids, awarding rebates and execution cost overruns, whereas it is negatively associated with delivery delays for PWC. The effect of Mafia infiltration on execution cost overruns and the probability of their occurrence is weaker for larger PWC, and the elections of the new municipal councils, after the dissolution of the previous ones, do not significantly influence the performance of PWC. Our findings suggest the presence of collusive schemes among bidding firms within the Mafia network and provide new insights for the implementation of more sound policies to tackle practices associated with Mafia infiltration in public procurement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;Corruption, Mafia infiltration, Public procurement;;"Aidt, T.S., Castro, V., Martins, R., Shades of red and blue: government ideology and sustainable development (2018) Publ.

This process involves different steps: the design of the tender process, the choice of tender selection methods, and scoring rules for evaluating tenders—the ex post control. Due to the interconnections between the rules on public contracts and those aimed to tackle corruption, the choice of tender selection methods and scoring rules for evaluating tenders assumes a crucial importance. The criterion usually used to select the best tender is the most economic advantageous tender (MEAT) based on the evaluation of technical requirements, on the one hand, and economic offer, on the other hand. First, this paper highlights some critical issues on the weighted sum method and some analytical formulas, commonly used to calculate the MEAT. Then, in order to apply a unique procedure and limit some risks of corruption and collusive agreements, it proposes to implement a unified group-AHP approach: In particular, a group-AHP model is applied for analyzing the qualitative component and another AHP model is used for the quantitative component. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;AHP, Collusive agreements, Corruption, Most economically advantageous tender, Public procurement;"Analytic hierarchy process; Crime; Analytical formulas; Corruption; Most economically advantageous tender; Public contracts; Public procurement; Selection methods; Technical requirement; Weighted sum method; Hierarchical systems";"Aruldoss, M., Lakshmi, T.M., Venkatesan, V.P., A survey on multi criteria decision making methods and its applications (2013) Am J Inf Syst, 1 (1), pp. 31-43; Bana-Costa, C.A., Corra, E.C., De Corte, J.M., Vansnick, J.C., Facilitating bid evaluation in public call for tenders: a socio-technical approach (2002) Omega, 30, pp. 227-242; Diabagaté, A., Azmani, A., El Harzli, M., The choice of the best proposal in tendering with AHP method: case of procurement of IT master plan’s realization (2015) Int J Inf Technol Comput Sci, 12, pp. 1-11; (2014) Directive 2014/24/EU on Public Procurement and Repealing Directive 2004/18/EC, 26 February 2014, , European Parliament and Council; (2016) Implementation Act of Legislative Decree 18 April 2016, No. 50 Bearing the ?

Such interventions should, in principle, overcome implementation gaps and make it easier to evaluate impact, supporting learning. However, when interventions are narrowly targeted, there is a risk that corrupt actors simply adapt, shifting their focus to areas with weaker controls, so that overall corruption is not reduced but merely displaced. We analyse data points from World Bank-funded development aid tenders over 12 years in >100 developing countries, and observe the heterogeneous effects of a 2003 anti-corruption reform aimed at increasing oversight and opening up competition. Our tight matching estimations suggest that the reform is effective in the targeted area: it decreases corruption risks due to low competition (the share of single bidding falls from 22% to18%). But we also find that evasive tactics largely cancel out these positive direct effects: buyers switch to non-treated less competitive procedure types (whose share increases from 7% to 10%) and exploit them more intensively (single bidding goes from 61% to 81%). Our results demonstrate how data analytics can be used to observe public procurement at the system level to inform more adaptive and effective anti-corruption programming. More broadly, we underline that technical interventions might not represent the best way to tackle systemic corruption, instead strategies should target the root causes of corruption and contribute to building a culture of integrity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;Adaptive programming, Aid, Anti-corruption, Public procurement, Regulatory governance, Unintended consequences;"aid; corruption; developing world; reform process; World Bank";"Andersson, S., Heywood, P.M., The Politics of Perception: Use and Abuse of Transparency International's Approach to Measuring Corruption (2009) Political Studies, 57, pp. 746-767; Andrews, M., Pritchett, L., Woolcock, M., (2013), pp. 234-244. , ‘Escaping Capability Traps through Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation (PDIA)’, World Development.

The U.S. Department of Defense, NATO, the EU, UN, OECD, and WTO, all authorize losing bidders to protest public procurements. The threat of a protest is meant to increase government accountability, and encourage vendor participation. An extensive legal and regulatory literature discusses intended benefits of protests, but is surprisingly silent about the costs. The goal of this study is to examine both costs and benefits. Military acquisition offers an illustration. The dual objective is to minimize corruption, and maximize competition. Sadly, protest systems can inadvertently discourage both. Moreover, past protests by defense companies have generated significant costs, and triggered dangerous delays of critical defense equipment, materiel, services, and supplies required for national security. The static, probabilistic, micro-economic, partial equilibrium, representative bidder model presented in this paper offers a cautionary tale for defense organizations, government agencies, countries, and international institutions that authorize bid protests. The model reveals multiple potential deficiencies of protest systems, and recommends analysis of portfolios of alternatives to eliminate fraud and favoritism, and increase competition, to improve procurement outcomes. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;acquisition, competition, corruption, procurement, Protest;;"Arena, M.V., Persons, B., Blickstein, I., Chenoweth, M.E., Lee, G.T., Luckey, D., Schendt, A., (2018) Assessing Bid Protests of U.S. Department of Defense Procurements: Identifying Issues, Trends, and Drivers, , https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2356.html, RAND Corporation, and,.

Thus, corruption in procurement was manifested in 69% of cases in more than 2,400 fraudulent cases detected in organizations across all continents [15]. Since 2015 Ukraine is trying to reform the most corrupt system of public procurement – healthcare sector. According to the Deputy Minister of Health on European Integration O. Stefanishina, up to 40% of the funds were overexpended on the purchase of medicines, vaccines and medicinal products [11]. According to the Law of Ukraine “On Public Procurement”, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine (hereinafter – the MH of Ukraine), with the aim of improving the quality of procurement procedures, ensuring economy of budget funds and satisfying the needs of customers in the field of health care by medicinal products and medicines, has approved the Concept of the Reform of the Mechanisms of Public Procurement of Medicinal Products and Medicines (hereinafter – the Concept) by the order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine dated from August 23, 2017, No. 582-r. In accordance with the Concept, the Centralized Procurement Organization (hereinafter – the CPO) was established, whose functions in 2019 were assigned to the State Enterprise “Medical Procurement of Ukraine”. Besides, in order to overcome corruption in the field of public procurement of medicines and medicinal products, the MH of Ukraine has been procuring medicines for the fifth consecutive year through international organizations (UNDP, UNICEF Children’s Fund and Crown Agents UK procurement agency [13]), which saved up to 40% of budget funds. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

The main response to those worries has been increased transparency, but so far empirical evidence of its efficiency remains scant and mixed. This article argues that the beneficial effects of transparency on corruption are contingent on type of transparency, and in particular, who the intended receiver of the information is. Drawing on newly collected data of more than 3.5 million government contracts between 2006 and 2015, the analysis shows that overall tender transparency reduces corruption risks substantially, yet that the effect is largely driven by ex ante transparency, that is, transparency that allows for horizontal monitoring by insiders in the bidding process. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;;;"Alonso, J.M., Clifton, J., Díaz-Fuentes, D., Did new public management matter?

The public understands corruption as something detrimental to state finances. In Law 31 : 1999 in conjunction with Law 20 : 2001 concerning Eradication of Corruption Crime there are 30 types of corruption. One of the seven Corruption Crime groups is gratification. Two of the seven principles of gratification control are transparency and accountability. The principle of openness is reflected in the mechanism for reporting on receipt of gratuities to the Corruption Eradication Commission. This study attempts to identify various aspects associated with the potential occurrence of corruption in the procurement of Government sector infrastructure projects based on a literature review through existing legislation in Indonesia. The results of the study are expected to be able to find indicators as potential corruption in public infrastructure procurement. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.;;;"https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2019/02/08/12301311/5-sektor-yang-paling-banyak-dikorupsi-selama-2018-dana-desa-peringkat-satu, Abba Gabrillin, 5 Sektor yang Paling Banyak dikorupsi selama 2018, Dana Desa Peringkat Satu, tayang di Kompas. com, 8 Februari 2019, (13 Juni 2019); https://beritagar.id/artikel/editorial/cegah-korupsi-di-sektor-infrastruktur, Redaksi Beritagar, Cegah Korupsi di Sektor Infrastruktur, 29 Januari 2019, (13 Juni 2019); Andi, M., Arief, Korupsi Menghantui Proyek Infrastruktur, , https://nasional.kontan.co.id/news/korupsi-menghantui-proyek-infrastruktur, 18 Juli 2018, (13 Juni 2019); Fasabeni, M., Korupsi Infrastruktur Dan Kegagalan Nawacita, , http://www.gresnews.com/berita/isu_terkini/116734-korupsi-infrastruktur-dan-kegagalan-nawacita/, 24 Januari 2019, (13 Juni 2019); Haryanti, R., (2019), https://properti.kompas.com/read/2019/02/17/200301221/fitra-proses-pencairan-dana-celah-korupsi-infrastruktur, FITRA: Proses Pencairan Dana, Celah Korupsi Infrastruktur, 17 Februari (13 Juni 2019); Anonim, Undang-Undang Nomor 21 Tahun 2001 Tentang Perubahan Atas Undang-undang Nomor 31 Tahun 1999 Tentang Pemberantasan Tindak Pidana Korupsi; Doni M, Buku Saku Memahami Gratifikasi, Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi, Desember 2010; Anonim, Undang-Undang Nomor 30 Tahun 2002 Tentang Komisi Pemberantasan Tindak Pidana Korupsi; Anonim, Undang-Undang Nomor 31 Tahun 1999 Tentang Pemberantasan Tindak Pidana Korupsi; Soerjono, S., Sri, M., (2018) Penelitian Hukum Normatif Suatu Tinjauan Singkat, pp. 23-29; Anonim, Undang-Undang Nomor 14 Tahun 2008 Tentang Keterbukaan Informasi Publik; Meilisa, H., (2019) KPK Sebut 80% Korupsi Terkait Pengadaan Barang Dan Jasa, , https://news.detik.com/berita-jawa-timur/d-4448060/kpk-sebut-80-korupsi-terkait-pengadaan-barang-dan-jasa, 28 Februari (11 Juni 2016); https://www.antikorupsi.org/id/kajian/tren-korupsi-pbj-2017, ICW, Tren Penindakan Kasus Korupsi Pengadaan Barang dan Jasa Tahun 2017, (11 Juni 2019); Fernandez, N., (2019) Keberhasilan Infrastruktur Era Jokowi Menghasilkan Celah Korupsi, , https://kabar24.bisnis.com/read/20190217/15/889793/keberhasilan-infrastruktur-era-jokowi-tinggalkan-celah-korupsi, 17 Februari (11 Juni 2019); Marta, F., (2016) Akuntabilitas Dan Transparansi Proyek Infrastruktur Jangan Diabaikan, , https://money.kompas.com/read/2016/05/10/131121326/Akuntabilitas.dan.Transparasi.Proyek.Infrastruktur.Jangan.Diabaikan?page=all, 10 Mei (11 Juni 2019); Sunaryanto, A., (2018) Transparansi Pengadaan Pemerintah, , https://antikorupsi.org/id/news/transparansi-pengadaan-pemerintah, 15 Maret (11 Juni 2019); Ari Wibawa, D., https://www.pengadaan.web.id/2016/10/6-praktik-yang-memicu-tindak-pidana-korupsi-dalam-pengadaan-barang-dan-jasa.html, 6 Praktik yang Memicu Tindak Pidana Korupsi dalam Pengadaan Barang dan Jasa, (11 Juni 2019)";Conference Paper;Final;All Open Access, Gold;Scopus;2-s2.0-85086722590

In the area of public procurement through Directives 89/665 and 2007/66, the structure of resource procedures for the award of public supply and works contracts has been regulated, which has been incorporated by national systems through various institutes. In the Italian case, the transposition of European Law has been carried out in respect of its legal culture, so that public procurement’ remedies are subject to the contentious-administrative jurisdiction, giving competence to Regional Administrative Courts, and also to the Council of State, through a special procedure. Similarly, the existence of a pre-contentious procedure before the ANAC is relevant, with strong anti-corruption measures, as well as the creation of preventive control measures of litigiousness, such as the existence of access rates to jurisdiction and sanctions against reckless litigants. Finally, tools for the restoration of law will be analysed, where faculties are contemplated for the procedures later to the awarding of the contract. © 2020, Iustel.

Design/methodology/approach: It uses the PetroTiger case to examine the effects of foreign bribery prosecutions in Colombia, from a bribe-receivers perspective. PetroTiger is a USA-based company that was prosecuted for bribing public officials in Colombia. As a result, the public officials involved were also prosecuted in Colombia for receiving bribes. This case serves to illustrate how international anti-bribery law operates in practice and how it impacts Colombian law enforcement institutions and their capacity to prosecute bribe-receivers. The Colombian response to the international anti-corruption framework is examined in this study through the review of legislative efforts taken to address the problems of bribery and corruption in public procurement. Findings: This study finds that enforcement of foreign bribery laws raise awareness of the situation of corruption in developing countries, generate parallel prosecutions of individuals at the receiving end of bribes and helps developing countries to develop technical expertise to fight corruption. Practical implications: In practice, due to the transnational nature of foreign bribery, without international agreements, this type of corruption in international business would seldom lead to prosecution. Although the effectiveness of the enforcement of international anti-corruption law is debated, in reality, prosecutions of foreign bribery by developed countries have more positive than negative implications for developing countries. Social implications: Assist to continue efforts to deter corruption. Originality/value: No many studies have looked at the effectiveness of anti-corruption international law in developing countries.

The authors use the data set of public contracts awarded by European Union (EU) member states between 2010 and 2017 to analyse its usage patterns. In particular, the authors identify the types of contracting authorities that mainly use the procedure, the sectors and contract characteristics and the role of institutional factors related to the country’s perceived corruption and level of innovativeness. Design/methodology/approach: The authors discuss economic and legal issues in the use of the competitive dialogue. The authors use a data set of public contracts awarded by EU member states, published on the EU’s public procurement portal Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) to analyse usage patterns and explore the types of contracting authorities that use the procedure, the sectors and type of tenders. The data covers a sample of 1.242.090 observations, which relates to all the contract award notices published on TED in the period 2010-2017 for all the 28 European member states. A probit model is used as a methodology. Findings: The empirical analysis reveals that the use of competitive value is greater for larger value contracts, for national rather than local authorities, for the supply of other manufactured products and machinery; for research and development and business, as well as information technology services; and for construction works. The level of perceived corruption and the gross domestic product/capita do not have explanatory power in the use of the procedure, whilst a country’s degree of innovativeness, as measured by the global innovation index, positively affects the probability of adopting the procedure. A decreasing trend in the use of competitive dialogue over time is observed. Research limitations/implications: In conclusion, the countries examined benefited from a long tradition of public–private partnerships (PPPs) and from a transposition of the 2004 directive, able to provide an inclusive interpretation of complexity, and therefore, stimulate the adoption of the competitive dialogue in different sectors. Conversely, the countries, which postponed a concrete transposition and the overcoming of the confusing concept of complexity, limited the scope for the application of competitive dialogue, relying on the easier alternative: the negotiated procedure. Those circumstances lead to visible difficulties in stimulating the adoption of the procedure even in the traditional sectors; indeed, only with the new directive’s provisions a slight change in the trend can be seen. Practical implications: To foster the use of the competitive dialogue in countries that have so far used it to a limited extent is important to improve upon the definition of complexity and learn from the experience of the top usage countries, as identified in the analysis. Social implications: Helping the use of the procedure may facilitate the procurement of complex contracts such as PPPs, and thus, ease the building and management of public infrastructures for the provision of public services. Originality/value: The authors are not aware of previous studies that have used the TED data set and studied the law in a number of European countries so as to understand the usage patterns for the competitive dialogue. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.";Competitive dialogue, European policy, European procurement policy, Innovation, Public procurement, Public sector;;"Arrowsmith, S., Treumer, S., (2012) Competitive Dialogue in EU Procurement, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Bovis, C.H., EU public procurement law (2007) Elgar European Law Series, , Edward Elgar Publishing, Cheltenham; Coviello, D., Guglielmo, A., Spagnolo, G., The effect of discretion on procurement performance (2017) Management Science, 64 (2), pp. 495-981; De Mars, S., (2011) The Influence of Recent Developments in EU Procurement Law on the Procurement Regulation of Member States: A Case Study of the UK, The Netherlands and France, , University of Nottingham, Nottingham; (2010) Procurement of PPP and the Use of Competitive Dialogue in Europe a Review of Public Sector Practices across the EU, , European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, EPEC Center, London; (2005) Explanatory note – Competitive Dialogue – classic directive, , document CC/2005/04, European Commission; Haugbølle, K., Pihl, D., Gottlieb, S.C., Competitive dialogue: driving innovation through procurement?

In this paper, we use as a case study the public procurement data from Paraguay, available in the open data format of the Open Contracting Data Standard, to train an unsupervised learning model for anomaly detection based on the Isolation Forest algorithm. The Open Contracting Data Standard allows the developed technique to be replicated in other countries that implement the same data standard, thus achieving an interoperable solution. The resulting classification enables the scoring of contracts and procurement processes which can be used to identify anomalies and make it possible to obtain an intelligent sampling of the data. This can be utilized as a support in the task of the government in its role to regulate and control the public procurements. The effectiveness of the model is validated with local known anomalous procurement processes, which are: a)processes protested by entities involved in the contracting process, which were determined in favor of the protestant, and b)complaints about the contracting process from external entities with the possibility of anonymity. The results show an accuracy of over 90 % in detecting these known anomalies as early as in the tender stage and during the contracting stage. Thus indicating a feasible approach for anomaly detection in public procurements. © 2020 IEEE.;Anomaly Detection, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, Open Contracting, Open Data;"Open Data; Contracting process; Data standards; Intelligent samplings; Paraguay; Procurement process; Public funds; Public procurement; Quality of life; Anomaly detection";"Auriol, E., Flochel, T., Straub, S., Public procurement and rent-seeking: The case of Paraguay (2011) TSE Working Papers 11-224, Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), , Feb; Wang, Y., Detecting fraud in public procurement (2016) Stony Brook Theses and Dissertations Collection, 8; https://www.open-contracting.org/resources/red-flags-integrity-giving-green-light-open-data-solutions/, O.

What is the optimal level of corruption for doing so? In this paper I use suspicious patterns of public procurement allocations in local government as a proxy measurement of corruption, based on combining quantitative and qualitative evidence on corrupt practices in local government. I then tie suspicious procurements to re-election probabilities of mayors in Croatian cities and municipalities from 2009 to 2017, and find that due to a rent-extracting relationship formed between firms and political elites, local politicians can engage in potential corruption and still win elections. There is an optimal level of suspicious procurements for which politicians maximize their re-election chances. When a mayor surpasses the cut-off level of around 20% of suspiciously allocated funds from public procurement his or her probability of re-election starts to decline, while he or she loses office for at least one half of all procurements allocated suspiciously. In order to address potential endogeneity issues I apply a fuzzy regression discontinuity design based on population thresholds that determine the size of the local council, where the intensity of the treatment (potential corruption) increases with increasing council size. The results overall confirm the hypothesized nonlinear relationship between corruption and re-election. © 2019 Association for Comparative Economic Studies;Corruption, Local government, Re-election, Suspicious procurement;;"Angrist, J.D., Pischke, J.S., Mostly Harmless Econometrics.

The growth of nuclear power capacity had relied on sustained government support and close coordination with key state-owned enterprises. The tight relationship between politicians, government and companies has resulted in what is colloquially known as the 'nuclear mafia'. One year after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan, Korea's nuclear industry suffered its own crises in 2012. The first was a station blackout at the Kori 1 reactor, the country's oldest, which was not reported for over a month. The second set of revelations concerned systematic malfeasance along the nuclear supply chain involving the falsification of reports of safety tests on nuclear parts and equipment. Revisions to the Nuclear Safety Act gave greater powers to the newly created Nuclear Safety and Security Commission and placed new reporting obligations on all actors along the nuclear supply chain. These measures were supplemented by more general legislation and regulations on public procurement, the conduct of public officials and corruption. Whilst these steps have the potential to improve governance and integrity in the country's nuclear power industry, some of the underlying causes of the earlier weaknesses remain. As a consequence, the transformation of Korea's nuclear industry will be a long process. © 2020 The Author(s).

This goal can be undercut if corruption infiltrates the procurement process. Good procurement practices can help mitigate the risks of corruption and support equitable access to affordable and high-quality medicines. Objectives: This paper aims to 1) examine manifestations of corruption in the pharmaceutical procurement process and key factors behind them, and 2) identify how to design and implement effective anti-corruption, transparency and accountability mechanisms within this process. Methods: This paper was informed by a narrative literature review from 1996 to the present. The search focused on publications that addressed the issue of pharmaceutical procurement and governance and corruption issues. Our search included peer-reviewed literature, books, grey literature such as working papers, reports published by international organizations and donor agencies, and some media articles. Some documents used in this paper were already known to the authors. Results: Procurement is highly vulnerable to corruption particularly in the health sector. What is more, corruption in the procurement process does not appear to be limited to any one level of government or type of health system. The better integration of accountability, transparency and anti-corruption mechanisms in the procurement process is needed to reduce the risk of corruption. Conclusions: Lessons learned suggest that anti-corruption, transparency and accountability mechanisms in the pharmaceutical procurement process, such as open contracting and integrity pacts are helpful towards reducing the risk of corruption. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Adopting e-filing systems reduces tax compliance costs as measured by the time to prepare and pay taxes, the likelihood and frequency of firms being visited by a tax official, and the perception of tax administration as an obstacle to firms' operation and growth. E-filing is also associated with a moderate increase in the income tax revenue to GDP ratio. The results for e-procurement are weaker, with the number of firms securing or attempting to secure a government contract increasing only in countries with higher levels of development and better institutions. There is no strong relationship between e-government and corruption. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.;corruption, e-government, public procurement, tax compliance costs, tax revenue;"competitiveness; compliance; corruption; fiscal policy; Gross Domestic Product; perception; state role; tax system";"Aker, J., Mbiti, I., Mobile phones and economic development in Africa (2010) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 24 (3), pp. 207-232; Ali, M., Shifa, A., Shimeles, A., Woldeyes, F., (2015) Information Technology and Fiscal Capacity in a Developing Country: Evidence from Ethiopia, , ICTD Working Paper No. 31, International Center for Tax and Development, Brighton, UK; Alm, J., Martinez-Vazquez, J., McClellan, C., Corruption and firm tax evasion (2016) Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 124, pp. 146-163; Andersen, T.B., E-government as an anti-corruption strategy (2009) Information Economics and Policy, 21 (3), pp. 201-210; Auriol, E., Straub, S., Flochel, T., Public procurement and rent-seeking: The case of Paraguay (2016) World Development, 77, pp. 395-407; Autor, D.H., Outsourcing at will: The contribution of unjust dismissal doctrine to the growth of employment outsourcing (2003) Journal of Labor Economics, 21 (1), pp. 1-42; Banerjee, A., Duflo, E., Imbert, C., Mathew, S., Pande, R., (2016) E-Governance, Accountability, and Leakage in Public Programs: Experimental Evidence from a Financial Management Reform in India, , NBER Working Paper No. 22803, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA; Barnwal, P., (2014) Curbing Leakage in Public Programs with Biometric Identification Systems: Evidence from India's Fuel Subsidies, , Mimeo, Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs, New York; Bertrand, M., Duflo, E., Mullainathan, S., How much should we trust differences-in-differences estimates?

Federal Police and audit agencies investigate collusion (bid-rigging), over-pricing, and delivery fraud in this field and efforts have been employed to early detect fraud and collusion on public works procurements. The current automatic methods of fraud detection use structured data to classification and usually do not involve annotated data. The use of NLP for this kind of application is rare. Our work introduces a new dataset formed by public procurement calls available on Brazilian official journal (Diário Oficial da União), using by 15,132,968 textual entries of which 1,907 are annotated risky entries.

In particular, despite the existence of several green-crimes , one of them is getting wide attention due to its impact on the global warming: CO2 carbon-Trading crime. In this respect, since 2009 several cases of embezzlement using the EU s carbon-Trading scheme were reported causing hundreds of millions of damages/losses. Consequentially, legitimate questions about the efficacy of the legal framework within which the CO2 carbon-Trading crime is regulated were asked. In that respect, this study conducted a review of the literature on this crime in order to shed a light on its potential connection with the perceived level of corruption in the public procurement. Indeed, despite the adoption of strict legal norms as a consequence of the Paris agreement, corruption can have a detrimental effect on their applicability. The findings revealed that several researches identified an existing connection between the so called shadoweconomy , which is characterized by a systematized corruption at an institutional level, and the registered rate of CO2-emissions. This evidence needs to be further explored in future studies to identify areas of improvement for criminal laws targeting corruption as, indeed, one of the main threats to the effective implementation of green policies. © 2020 Editions Eres.

The first part of the article is devoted to the analysis of the‘conflict of interest’ concept under the procurement Directive, concluding that it rests on three fundamental pillars: (a) a broad and functional subjective application based on the objective nature of the phenomenon; (b) a transfer of power (and responsibility) to the contracting entities; and (c) the strong relevance of the principle of proportionality. This new concept of conflict of interest at EU level and the recent CJEU case law in the field suggest a reduction of Member States’ deference in the transposition of optional exclusion grounds. In the present article, the case of Spain is used as an example to illustrate how the interpretative implications of the current EU framework do not leave virtually any margin to Member States to adapt the conflict of interests provisions to national legal traditions. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands";administrative law, anti-corruption, causes of exclusion, conflicts of interests, EU law, integrity, public law, public procurement law;;"de Witte, B., Using International Law in the Euro Crisis Causes and Consequences, Work.

Among the documents of the PA, the judgments, which can contain information on criminal events that have an economic dimension, are particularly important: there is a flow of money generated by corruption or bribery and public procurement can be subject to disruption auction, just to mention some topics often brought to public opinion by the media. A possible source of data is that of the sentences issued by the Court of Cassation that can be obtained on the Web site http://www.italgiure.giustizia.it/sncass/. In this study, we present the preliminary results on 308 sentences of the Court of Cassation: information obtained with text mining—the names of companies, their legal form and the company name—is linked with additional information from business registers, creating the conditions for future economic analysis of criminal events. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;;"Crime; Economic analysis; Natural language processing systems; Public administration; Social aspects; Natural languages; Public opinions; Public procurement; Text mining";"Baiocchi, F., Bolasco, S., Canzonetti, A., Capo, F.M., (2005) Estrazione Di Informazione Da Testi per La Classificazione Automatica Di Una Base Documentale: La Soluzione Di Text Mining per l’Authority Della Concorrenza, in S.

Fraud detection mechanisms must thus also resort to recent technological developments to ensure that even new forms of complex fraud are detected in time. In this paper we present a system to facilitate fraud detection in Public Procurement in Portugal. It relies on three main components. Data on public procurement and involved entities is acquired from public sources and integrated into a graph-oriented database. A rules-engine enriches these data with information additional information, using legal rules or custom rules defined by the users. Finally, a graph-oriented User Interface is used to support decision-making, allowing users to quickly and efficiently explore and filter information, in a natural and geo-referenced way. The main goal of this system is to increase transparency by facilitating access to relevant information, and in this way contribute to the fairness of the whole public procurement procedure. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Fraud detection, Graph-oriented database, Network analysis, Public procurement;"Complex networks; Decision making; User interfaces; And filters; Fraud detection; Legal rules; New forms; Portugal; Public procurement; Rules engines; Technological development; Crime";"Bolton, R.J., Hand, D.J., Statistical fraud detection: A review (2002) Stat.

Governments need to ensure efficiency, transparency, and accountability, while creating healthy, competitive, and vibrant economies. In this context, we built a platform, consisting of a set of modular APIs and ontologies to publish, curate, integrate, analyse, and visualise an EU-wide, cross-border, and cross-lingual procurement knowledge graph. We developed end-user tools on top of the knowledge graph for anomaly detection and cross-lingual document search. This paper describes our experiences and challenges faced in creating such a platform and knowledge graph and demonstrates the usefulness of Semantic Web technologies for enhancing public procurement. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Knowledge graph, Linked data, Public procurement;"Anomaly detection; Knowledge representation; Cross-border; Cross-lingual; Document search; End users; European union; Knowledge graphs; Public procurement; Semantic Web technology; Semantic Web";"Alvarez-Rodríguez, J.M., New trends on e-Procurement applying semantic technologies (2014) Comput.

Other benefits include ease of access to public tenders and easier detection of irregularities. One of the main challenges with the existing e-procurement/auction systems is ensuring bid privacy of the losing bidders and collusion between bidders and auctioneer. Most of the auction systems, proposed, depend either upon auctioneer(s) or on the trusted third party, which, according to us, is the biggest problem for addressing corruption. We propose a blockchain based solution for Public Procurement, which eliminates auctioneers/third-parties using secure multi-party computation (MPC). Our solution fully preserves bid privacy and is secure against malicious bidders. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Blockchain, Homomorphic encryption, Multi-party computation, Privacy, Public Procurement, Sealed-bid auction;"Crime; e-Procurement; E-procurement systems; Government activities; Privacy preserving; Public procurement; Public tender; Secure multi-party computation; Trusted third parties; Blockchain";"Abe, M., Suzuki, K., M + 1-st price auction using homomorphic encryption (2002) PKC 2002.

The current traditional procurement system being carried out in Nigeria is conducted manually and is replete with various problems such as elongated tendering time leading to corruption, time wastage, interference, excessive paper work and manipulation of the tender process resulting in lack of transparency in the entire procurement processes. The methodology used is a conceptual review of literature on e-procurement using a wide range of materials including journal articles, conference papers as well as internet sources. The benefits of, and challenges to e-procurement adoption were divulged. The findings of the study showed that improved transparency, increase productivity, cost saving, improved integrity and reduced corruption in the procurement process are the benefits of e-procurement adoption. The findings also revealed that high cost of investment in IT infrastructure and lack of technical expertise and training are the two factors with the most significant effect on the adoption of e-procurement in Nigeria. Others are political, social, and cultural issues; lack of top management support and legal issues. The study is expected to uncover the actual benefits and challenges in order to facilitate the adoption of e-procurement in Nigeria. © 2020, Construction Research Institute of Malaysia.

Creating a quality model as a foundation to perform a quality analysis largely depends on the quality and volume of data that is analyzed. It is important to find a way to identify anomalies before they occur and to prevent any kind of harm that is of public interest. For this reason, we focused our research on an early phase of the PPP, the preparation of the tender documentation. During this phase, it is important to collect documents, detect and extract quality content from it, and analyze this content for any possible manipulation of the PPP’s outcome. Part of the documentation related to defining the rules and restrictions for the PPP is usually within a specific section of the documents, often called “technical and professional ability.” In previous studies, the authors extracted and processed these sections and used extracted content in order to develop a prediction model for indicating fraudulent activities. As the criteria and conditions can also be found in other parts of the PPP’s documentation, the idea of this research is to detect additional content and to investigate its impact on the outcome of the prediction model. Therefore, our goal was to determine a list of relevant terms and to develop a data science model finding and extracting terms in order to improve the predictions of suspicious tender. An evaluation was conducted based on an initial prediction model trained with the extracted content as additional input parameters. The training results show a significant improvement in the output metrics. This study presents a methodology for detecting the content needed to predict suspicious procurement procedures, for measuring the relevance of extracted terms, and for storing the most important information in a relational structure in a database.

The increasing number of anti-corruption measures that have arisen around the world in the past few decades testify to the importance of this issue. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the anti-corruption measures that exist internationally in the field of public procurement. This paper will also research and analyze the innovations that have been adopted into Ukrainian legislation, and consider their impact on overcoming corruption in the public economy sector. The results of the study show that thanks to public procurement reforms, the introduction of e-procurement, transparency in the tender processes, and increased leverage on unfair bidders, there has been a tendency to make savings in public finances. At the same time, competition remains low due to imperfect legislation and low trust in the integrity of officials. In the fight against corruption, the authors consider it necessary to increase competition in procurement by enhancing operational control of procedures, namely the development of a public procurement monitoring system. The study presented reveals the widespread corruption schemes that have been developed in the system of public procurement in Ukraine, reveals the cause and effect of the inadequacy of the reforms carried out, and develops directions for further reforms of the system in order to overcome corruption in the public sector. © 2020 Mykolo Romerio Universitetas.

This study proposes that, in the absence of corruption, firm productivity is the main determinant of being awarded government contracts. In corrupt environments, however, most productive firms are excluded from bidding, and therefore, domestic-market oriented firms are better positioned to be awarded government contracts. To test this Hypothesis, a longitudinal database is constructed from the World Bank Enterprise Survey, containing 1,898 observations across 33 developing economies. The findings corroborate our hypotheses and shows that corruption negatively moderates the relationship between firm productivity and being awarded a government contract for pro-market firms. This moderation, however, is positive for rent-seeking firms. These findings point to an important policy implication. Since excluding pro-market firms from bidding increases the cost and reduces the quality of public services, one mechanism to ensure smarter public procurement decisions is to open bidding processes to exporting firms, which our evidence suggests pay less bribes and commit less informal acts than domestic-market oriented firms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd;Corruption, Developing countries, Exporting firms, Government contracts, Total factor productivity;;"Syriana (2005) quotes (2015), https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365737/quotes?ref_=tt_ql_trv_4, (Accessed 11 September 2019); Johnston, J.M., Girth, A.M., Government contracts and “managing the market” exploring the costs of strategic management responses to weak vendor competition (2012) Adm Soc, 44 (1), pp. 3-29; Cheaitou, A., Larbi, R., Al Housani, B., Decision making framework for tender evaluation and contractor selection in public organizations with risk considerations (2019) Socio-Econ.

However, given our limited capacity to detect corruption, it may simply be harder to detect it in countries with stronger institutions. This article sets out to address this measurement challenge and to offer a tailored approach to one particular type of corruption: high-level corruption in government contracting. We describe a recently developed method to score procurement contracts for corruption risk. Then, using micro-level data from Hungary and the Czech Republic we analyze how corruption can distort public procurement markets, mapped as networks of buyers and suppliers. Proxying for corruption using a com-posite index of red flags derived from contract awards, we find that public sector buyers with high corruption risk have sparser network neighborhoods, meaning that they contract with fewer suppliers than expected. We interpret our results as evidence that corruption in procurement markets is fundamentally about the exclusion of non-favored firms. Political change has a significant effect on corrupt relationships: High corruption risk buyers with sparse neighborhoods rewire their contracting relationships roughly 20–40% more extensively than other buyers across years with government turnover. The article demonstrates how the political organization of corruption distorts market competition in OECD countries. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).";Corruption, Government change, Markets, Networks, Political turnover;;"Aidt, T., Rent seeking and the economics of corruption (2016) Constitutional Political Economy, 27 (2), pp. 142-157; Albert, R., Barabási, A.

In a country like Iraq, which is very late in ranking the most corrupt countries in the world, this is reflected in poor services and the standard of living of its citisens. This research discusses the most important financial and administrative aspects of corruption in one of the most important aspects of executive work, which is public procurement which accounts for the largest percentage of the financial budgets of this country. This study attempts to review the most prominently applied cases that occur when government agencies exercise their activities in the field of purchasing goods and services. The study also deals with these aspects at every stage of the contract, which leads to the conclusion of contracts that are marred by imbalance and complicity. This results in sometimes being unable to achieve their purpose of providing goods and services with high efficiency and appropriate prices, as well as determining the criminal consequences of the perpetrators of the violations. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.;Administrative, Corruption, Criminal, Financial, Public procurement;;"Malloukh, A.F., (2002) Foundations of Economic Feasibility Studies for Economic Projects, Bustan Al-Maarefa Library, Alexandria; Shatnawi, A.K., (2003) The Summary in Administrative Law, Jordan, , Wael Publishing and Distribution House; Ali, N.I., Jacobs, A., Lipson, R., Isoldi, F., (2013) Public procurement reform in iraq: A long and difficult road; Sari, G.S., (2003) Principles and provisions of the Administrative Judiciary, , Arab Renaissance House, Cairo; Al-Badiri, I.S., Nural-Hadi, A.-H.A., (2012) The inspector general's oversight of the procedures leading to the announcement of the tender, research published in the Journal of the Investigator Al-Hali for Legal and Political Science, 7 (4); Matechak, J.P., Fighting Corruption in Public Procurement (2005) Center for International Private Enterprise 1155 15th St., NW, Suite 700--Washington, p. 1. , WWW.CIPE.ORG, DC 2005 202/721-9200 (tel)--202/721-9250 (fax); (2008) Concerning economic feasibility studies, Economic Feasibility Studies, Center for Graduate Studies and Research, Cairo University; (1996) The Principles of Administrative Law, A Comparative Study, , Dar Al-Kutub for Printing and Publishing, Mosul; (1998) The Legal System of Public Tenders, Comparative Study, Amman, , Dar Al-Thaqafa for Publishing and Distribution; (2010) Improving transparency within government procurement procedures in iraq, , OECD, Report; (2015) Detailed Provisions in Explaining Governmental Contracts, A Comparative Study, Law and Judiciary Library; Soreide, T., Corruption in public procurement (2002) Causes, consequences and cures.

The overall success of a digitized public-procurement function yields progress and economic growth for the nation. In this research, we analyze the potential of blockchain-based systems to enhance effectiveness, ease, and transparency in public procurement in the case of Nigeria and identify the current challenges facing public procurement, i.e., lack of trust and transparency among critical stakeholders in the procurement process, systems that only weakly support transaction recording and documentation, complex process structures, corruption in institutions involved in the procurement process. To address these issues, a blockchain-based framework is developed to enable interoperability of information-systems involved in the procurement process, increase citizen participation in eliciting project requirements and to enable a more transparent project monitoring and auditing. We apply the framework to a case study with respect to identifying on-chain activities that enable system interoperability, e-participation and project auditability. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.;Blockchain, Interoperability, Procurement, Project-monitoring, Smart contract;"Blockchain; Electronic commerce; Information use; Transparency; Citizen participation; Complex Processes; E-procurement systems; Procurement process; Project monitoring; Public procurement; Recording and documentations; System interoperability; Interoperability";"Abodei, E., Norta, A., Azogu, I., Udokwu, C., Draheim, D., Blockchain technology for enabling transparent and traceable government collaboration in public project processes of developing economies (2019) I3E 2019.

In this study, we analyzed differentness kinds of corruption like (bribery, collusion embezzlement, misappropriation, fraud, abuse of discretion, favoritism, nepotism), and six types of Artificial Intelligence techniques (classification, regression, clustering, prediction, outlier detection, and visualization). The methodology proposed by Torres-Carrion was used, and four research questions were raised, which allow knowing the types of research carried out, the characteristics of the organizations in which the investigations are carried out, the technological tools, and data mining methodologies and techniques. The search was done in the Scopus and Web of Science databases, getting 102 articles published between 2015 and 2019. The primary data mining techniques used are logistic models, neural networks, Bayesian networks, supported vector machines, and decision trees. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Artificial Intelligence, Corruption, Data mining, Procurement, Systematic literature review;"Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Crime; Decision trees; Trees (mathematics); Artificial intelligence techniques; Corruption; Procurement; Public procurement; Research questions; Supported vector machines; Systematic literature review; Technological tools; Data mining";"Báez Gómez, J.E., Relación entre el Índice de Control de la Corrupción y algunas variables sociales, económicas e institucionales (2013) Nómadas.

This article develops two objective proxy measures of high-level corruption in public procurement: single bidding in competitive markets and a composite score of tendering 'red flags'. Using official government data on 2.8 million contracts in twenty-eight European countries in 2009-14, we directly operationalize a common definition of corruption: unjustified restriction of access to public contracts to favour a selected bidder. Corruption indicators are calculated at the contract level, but produce aggregate indices consistent with well-established country-level indicators, and are also validated by micro-level tests.

The overarching purpose of this is to ingrain transparency, probity, and value for money into the processes of acquiring goods and services. When tenderers collude and clients are unable to detect them, bids will become uncompetitive. Yet, there have been a limited number of effective practical tools and methods developed that can be used by procurement authorities, controllers, and public officials to detect collusive tendering. Using data obtained from the Brazilian Federal Police and their ongoing criminal investigation titled Operation Car Wash, a robust and practical probabilistic method is developed. The main findings were that the method was able to accurately identify (81%-96%) the occurrence of collusion during a sealed tendering process. Conclusions are drawn from the lessons learned from the forensic investigations, indicating that the approach presented for detecting collusive behavior during tendering is grounded in reality. This paper presents a new way to utilize statistics and probability to identify the presence of and control collusion in public- and private-sector tendering. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.;Brazil, Collusion, Corruption, Public procurement, Sealed tender;"Civil engineering; Engineering; Brazil; Collusion; Corruption; Public procurement; Sealed tender; Crime";"(2011) Cartels Deterrence and Detection: A Guide for Government Procurement Officers, , https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/308_Cartels_Deterence%20and%20detection_26-Feb-2016.pdf, ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission).

In Nigeria, inadequate infrastructure has impaired the prospect of attaining some of these SDGs. Some of the identified barriers causing the poor implementations of SDGs in Nigeria include poverty, poor accountability, inadequate domestic water supply, poor energy supply, poor human capital development initiatives, poor transportation and telecommunication networks, illiteracy level, and environmental degradation. But while the SDGs are a non-enforced agreement, the way and manner of implementation and the conditions under which the state acts in accordance with the agenda were not properly spelled out. However, the success of the SDGs in Nigeria requires commitment from government at all levels to provide adequate funding, financial prudence, stable polity, sound policies, availability of functional infrastructural facilities and ensuring value for money. This will result in achieved opportunities such as the establishment of new businesses, boosting of employment rate, ample growth opportunities, enhance risk-adjusted financial returns to investors, an increase in the rate of youth and adults in formal education and non-formal education, and promoting environment friendliness. This review further recommends that government should address the challenges faced in the area of power, telecommunication, corruption and access to agrarian areas in the country in order to have an inclusive infrastructural development that is positively driving growth. Moreover, assessment of projects should include initial capital investment, operational cost, maintenance, and disposal of the asset which will guarantee more sustainable infrastructure projects that are likely to perform much better through the lifecycle. Thus, successfully achieving the SDGs must involve innovative approaches to infrastructure financing and sustainable public procurement. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

However, PPP is suffering from problems such as ‘long negotiation time’, ‘lack of transparency’, and ‘uneven risk and return allocation’, which in turn lead to ‘ineffective delivery’ and ‘poor value for money’. Using a case study, this paper reports some lessons learnt from innovative practices of procuring C&D management services in Suzhou, China. It is discovered that the public and private sectors, without prior knowledge, are operating based on a general concession framework instead of negotiating a clear-cut agreement from the outset. Several key arrangements, such as price, concession period, and strategic operations, are based on relational contract-type of agreements, which are found particularly innovative for shortening the negotiation time, fostering the trust between the relevant parties, dealing with emerging ad hoc problems, and allowing sustainable development of the circular economy. To make such PPP work, it is critical to devise institutions to prevent corruption and opportunistic behaviors. This research provides useful references to developing a circular economy. Although they focus on C&D waste management, the research findings can be applied to other public procurement settings, such as municipal solid waste management service. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;China, Circular economy, Construction and demolition (C&D) waste, Procurement innovation, Public Private Partnership, Relational contract;"Behavioral research; Demolition; Municipal solid waste; China; Circular economy; Construction and demolition; Public private partnerships; Relational contracts; Waste management; construction material; corruption; demolition; innovation; municipal solid waste; public-private partnership; sustainable development; waste management; article; China; construction and demolition waste; interpersonal communication; municipal solid waste; public-private partnership; sustainable development; trust; China; private sector; public-private partnership; solid waste; waste management; China; Jiangsu; Suzhou; China; Private Sector; Public-Private Sector Partnerships; Solid Waste; Waste Management";"Acerete, B., Stafford, A., Stapleton, P., Spanish healthcare public private partnerships: the ‘Alzira model’ (2011) Crit.

However, the data available on government procurement alone does not allow for the identification of possible signed contracts or bidding processes won by unfit or suspended companies, making it difficult to analyze and supervise by employees of tax agencies such as SEFAZ. In addition, data are often not available in the same common format and differ in their vocabulary, making it difficult for these professionals to find interesting information. As a means of solving these problems, the present work presents SemanticSefaz, a semantic portal for integration between heterogeneous bases focused on the domain of public procurement through a homogeneous view, allowing for semantic queries and subsequent discovery of information that priori were not possible. As a case study, the databases with data on government procurement (SIASG), unhealthy and suspenseful companies (CEIS) and punished companies (CNEP) were used to construct semantic integration. Subsequently, queries of interest to the tax domain were conducted through SemanticSefaz, demonstrating its efficiency for performing faceted queries and semantic navigation. In the end, SemanticSefaz is characterized as a timely tool for integration, visualization, discovery of knowledge to facilitate the work of tax professionals. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.;Government purchasing, Linked data, Semantic web;"Crime; Integration; Linked data; Purchasing; Semantic Web; Government procurement; Government spending; Illegal actions; Interesting information; Its efficiencies; Public procurement; Semantic integration; Semantic navigation; Ontology";"Berners-Lee, T., Hendler, J., Lassila, O., The semantic web (2001) Scientific American, 284 (5), pp. 28-37. , 2001; Bizer, C., Heath, T., Berners-Lee, T., Linked data: The story so far (2011) Semantic Services, Interoperability and Web Applications, pp. 205-227; Calvanese, D., Ontop: Answering SPARQL queries over relational databases (2017) Semantic Web, 8 (3), pp. 471-487. , 2017; Correa, A.S., (2017) Transparency and Open Government Data: A Wide National Assessment of Data Openness in Brazilian Local Governments; Da Cruz, S.M.S., De Oliveira Sampaio, J., Investigando a Mobilidade Urbana Através de Dados Abertos Governamentais Enriquecidos com Proveniência (2018) iSys-Revista Brasileira De Sistemas De Informação, 11, p. 2. , 2018; Madhavan, J., (2007) Web-Scale Data Integration: You Can Only Afford to Pay as You Go, , 2007; Mendes, P.N., Sieve: Linked data quality assessment and fusion (2012) 2012 Joint EDBT/ICDT Workshops., pp. 116-123. , Citeseer; De Santana, (2013) Sistema Eletrônico De Compras Governamentais: O De-Sempenho Do SIASG-Comprasnet E Sua Influência para O Futuro Das Compras Governamentais, , 2013; (2017) Compras Públicas: Um Bom Negócio para A Sua Empresa, , encurtador.com.br/bgvT7, Disponível em: < >; (2016) R2RML RDB to RDF Mapping Language, , W3C";Conference Paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85075609223

Empirical research in this area is relatively sparse. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using laboratory experiments. Findings: The results revealed that fraudulent behavior is higher when an individual has high pressure and high opportunity. These factors play an important role in determining individual rationalization. Most of participants used “displacing responsibility” to rationalize their actions. This study also demonstrated that negative affect mediates the relationship between fraudulent behavior and rationalization. Research limitations/implications: First, fraudulent behavior research cannot be separated from social desirability bias. Second, the experiments only involved individual decision-making, not in groups. Finally, this study did not examine the effectiveness of rationalization in reducing negative affect. Practical implications: Over the years, the government has only focused on the identification of pressure and reduction of opportunities, but ignored individual psychological reasons. Considering that procurement fraud is always increasing, the government must more focus on individual reasons to design an effective prevention and detection system. Social implications: There are various conflicts of interest in public procurement budgeting. These conflicts can distort resource allocation and causes budget leakage. As a result, the government is incapacitated to achieve social and economic goals of the community. Originality/value: There is limited research about fraud in public procurement budgeting, especially in developing countries. In addition, the fraud triangle research, which focuses on rationalization is still limited. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Fraud, Public procurement, Rationalization;;"Abbasi, A., Albrecht, C., Vance, A., Hansen, J., Metafraud: a meta-learning framework for detecting financial fraud (2012) Mis Quarterly, 36 (4), pp. 1293-1327; Aguilera, R.V., Vadera, A.K., The dark side of authority: antecedents, mechanisms, and outcomes of organizational corruption (2008) Journal of Business Ethics, 77 (4), pp. 431-449; Albrecht, C., Holland, D., Malagueno, R., Dolan, S., Tzafrir, S., The role of power in financial statement fraud schemes (2015) Journal of Business Ethics, 131 (4), pp. 803-813; Auriol, E., Corruption in procurement and public purchase (2006) International Journal of Industrial Organization, 24 (5), pp. 867-885; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator–mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51 (6), p. 1173; Basheka, B.C., Oluka, P.N., Karyeija, G.K., The nature and forms of public procurement corruption in Uganda’s local government systems: implications for good governance debate (2013) International Journal of Procurement Management, 6 (6), pp. 684-701; Becker, G.S., Crime and punishment: an economic approach (1968) Journal of Political Economy, 76 (2), pp. 169-217; Bishop, C.C., DeZoort, F.T., Hermanson, D.R., The effect of CEO social influence pressure and CFO accounting experience on CFO financial reporting decisions (2016) Auditing: A Journal of Practice and Theory, 36 (1), pp. 21-41; Brody, R.G., Melendy, S.R., Perri, F.S., Commentary from the American accounting association’s 2011 annual meeting panel on emerging issues in fraud research (2012) Accounting Horizons, 26 (3), pp. 513-531; Buchner, S., Freytag, A., Gonzalez, L.G., Guth, W., Bribery and public procurement: an experimental study (2008) Public Choice, 137 (1-2), pp. 103-117; Caulfield, T., Steckler, S., The five faces of procurement fraud, abuse, and noncompliance (2014) Contract Management, pp. 38-45; (2010) Deterring and detecting financial reporting fraud: a platform for action, , www.thecaq.org/deterring-and-detecting-financial-reporting-fraud, (accessed: 1 March 2017; (2014) Kajian pencegahan korupsi pada pengadaan barang dan jasa pemerintah (study of prevention of corruption in procurement of government goods and services), , https://acch.kpk.go.id/id/pengkajian/kajian-pencegahan-korupsi-pada-pengadaan-barang-dan-jasa-pemerintah; Cressey, D.R., (1953) Other People’s Money; a Study of the Social Psychology of Embezzlement, , Free Press, New York, NY; Davies, D., Purchasing and procurement fraud (1995) Journal of Financial Crime, 2 (4), pp. 322-330; Davis, S., DeZoort, F.T., Kopp, L.S., The effect of obedience pressure and perceived responsibility on management accountants’ creation of budgetary slack (2006) Behavioral Research in Accounting, 18 (1), pp. 19-35; Dellaportas, S., Conversations with inmate accountants: motivation, opportunity and the fraud triangle (2013) Accounting Forum, 37 (1), pp. 29-39; Dichev, I.D., Graham, J.R., Harvey, C.R., Rajgopal, S., Earnings quality: evidence from the field (2013) Journal of Accounting and Economics, 56 (2-3), pp. 1-33; Dorminey, J., Fleming, A.S., Kranacher, M.-J., Riley Jr, R.A., The evolution of fraud theory (2012) Issues in Accounting Education, 27 (2), pp. 555-579; (2014) EU Anti-Corruption Report; Feng, M., Ge, W., Luo, S., Shevlin, T., Why do CFOs become involved in material accounting manipulations?

Instead, the corporations serve as scapegoats and are paying to protect high-profile individuals. When an individual provides substantial cooperation, it still be possible to negotiate jail time and fine amounts, but not debarment or disgorgement for those who planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing. It is important to consider and motivate the disgorgement by forfeiture of shares or debarment of executives to ultimately change the control and the culture of the corporation. Additionally, it is necessary to enhance coordination across agencies and compliance offices, so that they can join particular skills and implement measures not taken before, although in different stages. The countries should help each other to implement these measures in a harmonized way, including through civil or administrative procedures, whether to recognize foreign decisions or start new procedures in favor of the victim country of corruption. International recommendations are necessary in this field. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;;;;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85074696844

A government pays costs to invite firms to the auction, and a bureaucrat who runs the auction may request a bribe from the winning firm. We first show that, with no corruption, the bureaucrat will invite more than the socially optimal number of firms to the auction. Second, the effects of corruption on equilibrium outcomes vary across different forms of bribery. For a fixed bribe, corruption does not affect equilibrium competition, yet it does induce social welfare loss. For a proportional bribe, the bureaucrat may invite either fewer or more firms, depending on how much he weights his private interest relative to the government payoff. Finally, we show that information disclosure may consistently induce more firms to be invited, regardless of whether there is corruption. © 2019, The Author(s).;;;"Acemoglu, D., Verdier, T., The choice between market failures and corruption (2000) Am Econ Rev, 90 (1), pp. 194-211; Ades, A., Di Tella, R., Rents, competition, and corruption (1999) Am Econ Rev, 89 (4), pp. 982-993; Alexeev, M., Song, Y., Corruption and product market competition: an empirical investigation (2013) J Dev Econ, 103, pp. 154-166; Amir, R., Burr, C., Corruption and socially optimal entry (2015) J Pub Econ, 123, pp. 30-41; Arnold, B.C., Balakrishnan, N., Nagaraja, H.N., (2008) A first course in order statistics, , SIAM, Philadelphia; Arozamena, L., Weinschelbaum, F., The effect of corruption on bidding behavior in first-price auctions (2009) Eur Econ Rev, 53, pp. 645-657; Auriol, E., Corruption in procurement and public purchase (2006) Int J Indus Organ, 24, pp. 867-885; Basu, K., (2011) Why, for a Class of Bribes, the Act of Giving a Bribe Should Be Treated as Legal, , Ministry of Finance, Government of India, Working Paper; Bliss, C., Di Tella, R., Does competition kill corruption?

We analyse empirically whether the WTO GPA is effective in promoting non-discriminatory, open, transparent, competitive, and cost-effective government procurement. To study this question, we use a unique data set recently released by the EU, covering more than three million tenders conducted in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and Macedonia during the years 2006-2016. We find that the WTO GPA promotes competition by increasing the probability of awarding a contract to a foreign firm. In addition, the WTO GPA significantly lowers corruption risk by decreasing the number of contracts with single bidders, and by decreasing total number of wins by a single firm. Finally, the WTO GPA fosters cost-effective public procurement by lowering the probability that the procurement price is higher than estimated cost. © Bedri Kamil Onur Taş et al.;;;"Bajari, P., Hortacsu, A., The winner's curse, reserve prices, and endogenous entry: Empirical insights from ebay auctions (2003) RAND Journal of Economics, 34, pp. 329-355; Billor, N., Hadi, A.S., Velleman, P.F., Bacon: Blocked adaptive computationally efficient outlier nominators (2000) Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, 34, pp. 279-298; Conley, T.G., Decarolis, F., Detecting bidders groups in collusive auctions (2016) American Economic Journal: Microeconomics, 8 (2), pp. 1-38; Estache, A., Iimi, A., Bidder asymmetry in infrastructure procurement: Are there any fringe bidders?

Considering that public procurement is the most vulnerable to corruption, attention should be paid to the strengthening of prosecutorial supervision in this field. According to the results of the study, the conclusion was made that with a decentralized model of public procurement, the risk of committing corruption crimes is much higher and necessitates the determination of this field as top priority for prosecutorial supervision. The paper is scientifically valuable, as it highlights the relevant and understudied topic of public procurement in Kazakhstan, allowing to comprehend the efficiency and prospects of prosecutorial supervision development in this field. © 2019, by ASERS® Publishing.

Guarnieri P., Gomes R.C.;"24922749500;27067631600;";Can public procurement be strategic? A future agenda proposition;2019;Journal of Public Procurement;19;4;;295;321;;12;10.1108/JOPP-09-2018-0032;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071698828&doi=10.1108%2fJOPP-09-2018-0032&partnerID=40&md5=684127fe52e1d11c49133f246f092195;"Purpose: This paper aims to demonstrate how public procurement can be strategic. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted following the protocol from Pagani, Kovaleski and Resende (2015), called Methodi Ordinatio, to select the relevant literature on this topic. The analysis of papers selected was carried out following the procedures of categorical content analysis (Bardin, 1977). Findings: In all, 68 full papers were analyzed from Science Direct and Web of Science. The results present the main characteristics of publications analyzed and the authors propose some categories of strategic practices related to public procurement that are in turn related to: sustainability, partnerships and supplier management, information systems and technology and other issues. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations of this paper are: the publication period considered of the articles selected is from January 2012 to March 2017; the databases Science Direct and Web of Science are selected as the sources of articles; the Methodi Ordinatio is used as the basic protocol of the SLR and, consequently, the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in the steps of the protocol are used. Practical implications: Showing how the public procurement can be strategic, this paper highlights the benefits of best procurement practices; similarly, it highlights those practices adopted by the private sector, which can highly contribute to the creation of value in public services that are aligned with the concept of obtaining “the best value for money”. Social implications: The incorporation of strategic practices in public procurement can result in the best expenditure of public resources and the reduction of corruption in the process of procurement. Originality/value: This paper contributes to synthesize the knowledge on strategic procurement, a topic exploited by few people in the public organizations. It differentiates from other literature reviews already published, considering that these studies do not deal, specifically, with public procurement and, also, do not use protocols of SLR. Moreover, this paper indicates a future agenda of research, which can aid researchers and practitioners acting in this field of knowledge. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.";Acquisition, Environmental and social issues, Partnerships, Procurement/purchasing processes, Strategic procurement/purchasing, Supplier management;;"Ahsan, K., Rahman, S., Green public procurement implementation challenges in Australian public healthcare sector (2017) Journal of Cleaner Production, 152, pp. 181-197; Alcalde, J., Dahm, M., Competition for procurement shares (2013) Games and Economic Behavior, 80, pp. 193-208; Almeida, W.A., Almeida, L.T., Guarnieri, P., A participação e o sucesso das microempresas e empresas de pequeno porte em compras públicas no Brasil: Uma replicação (the participation and the success of micro and small companies in the public procurement in Brasil: a replication (2017) Encontro Nacional de Pesquisa e Pós-Graduação em Administração, , São Paulo; Amann, M., K., Roehrich, J., Eßig, M., Harland, C., Driving sustainable supply chain management in the public sector (2014) Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, 19 (3), pp. 351-366; Arlbjørn, J.S., Freytag, P.V., Public procurement vs private purchasing: is there any foundation for comparing and learning across the sectors?

The fraud diamond view;2019;Journal of Public Procurement;19;4;;345;362;;12;10.1108/JOPP-02-2019-0012;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071608554&doi=10.1108%2fJOPP-02-2019-0012&partnerID=40&md5=075cd24185878205e5e913edb6f298e1;Purpose: This paper aims to discuss the factors that cause individuals to commit fraud, especially in the public procurement context. All this time, an empirical review of public procurement fraud has only focused on the macro and micro level, as well as its losses on the country's economy. This paper highlights individuals’ fraudulent behavior from the four elements of the fraud diamond theory, namely, pressure, opportunity, rationalization and capability. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a literature review that discusses the fraudulent behavior of bureaucrat as a procurement official in the context of public procurement. This review uses fraud diamond theory as its theoretical framework to explain the attributes to do fraud. Findings: Public procurement is a high-risk area for fraud (corruption), particularly in the government institution. It cannot be denied that the situation factor (pressure and opportunity) will interact with psychological aspects (rationalization) and individual capability to direct the individuals to commit fraud. This study discusses how existing pressure (motivation) and opportunities are used by individuals who have the capability to rationalize their actions. This literature review also endeavors to shed light on the strategy to prevent, detect and control the causes of fraud. Practical implications: This paper provides an understanding of regulators, auditors and other employees in recognizing the characteristics and nature of fraud antecedents. This understanding can help prevent various forms of procurement fraud that occur within their organizations. This paper also can be a guideline to assist public sector organizations in designing effective internal control systems to prevent fraud in the process and practice of public procurement. Social implications: Public procurement has a central role that enables the government to allocate the budget effectively and efficiently. Compliance in implementing procurement rules and procedures will improve the quality of public services. Originality/value: There exists relatively little study outlining the factors underlying of bureaucrats’ (procurement official) opportunistic behavior on procurement activities. The authors focused on bureaucrats’ behavior because they have unique positions of power and responsibility of the procurement process. On the one hand, they have a crucial role in serving the public and safeguarding public assets. On the other hand, they have the ability to collaborate with politicians and business actors in corrupt procurement practices. Therefore, the discussion on this topic is very relevant and interesting. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Bureaucrat, Capability, Fraud, Procurement;;"Achua, J.K., Anti-corruption in public procurement in Nigeria: challenges and competency strategies (2011) Journal of Public Procurement, 11 (3), pp. 323-333; Adeniyi, A., Analysis of fraud in banks: evidence from Nigeria (2016) International Journal of Innovative Finance and Economics Research, 4 (2), pp. 16-25; Akech, J.M., Public law values and the politics of criminal (in) justice: creating a democratic framework for policing in Kenya (2005) Oxford University Commonwealth Law Journal, 5 (2), pp. 225-256; Albrecht, C., Holland, D., Malagueno, R., Dolan, S., Tzafrir, S., The role of power in financial statement fraud schemes (2015) Journal of Business Ethics, 131 (4), pp. 803-813; Aronson, E., The theory of cognitive dissonance: a current perspective (1969) Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 4, pp. 1-34; Ashforth, B.E., Anand, V., The normalization of corruption in organizations (2003) Research in Organizational Behavior, 25, pp. 1-52; (2019) Combatting procurement fraud, , www.theaicp.org/combatting-procurement-fraud/, (accessed: 20 January 2019; Ateljevic, J., Budak, J., Corruption and public procurement: example from Croatia (2010) Journal of Balkan and near Eastern Studies, 12 (4), pp. 375-397; Basheka, B.C., Economic and political determinants of public procurement corruption in developing countries: an empirical study from Uganda (2011) Journal of Public Procurement, 11 (1), pp. 33-60; Benson, M.L., Madensen, T.D., Eck, J.E., White-collar crime from an opportunity perspective (2009) The Criminology of White-Collar Crime, 3, pp. 175-193; Blackburn, K., Bose, N., Haque, M.E., Public expenditures, bureaucratic corruption and economic development (2011) The Manchester School, 79 (3), pp. 405-428; Brytting, T., Minogue, R., Morino, V., (2011) The Anatomy of Fraud and Corruption: Organizational Causes and Remedies, , Gower Publishing; Budiman, A., Roan, A., Callan, V.J., Rationalizing ideologies, social identities and corruption among civil servants in Indonesia during the suharto era (2013) Journal of Business Ethics, 116 (1), pp. 139-149; Campbell, J.W., Public procurement policy in South Korea: approaches to sustainable development and anti-corruption (2017) The Experience of Democracy and Bureaucracy in South Korea, pp. 159-179; Caulfield, T., Steckler, S., The five faces of procurement fraud, abuse, and non compliance (2014) Contract Management, Vol. December, pp. 38-45; (2010) Deterring and detecting financial reporting fraud: a platform for action, , www.thecaq.org/deterring-and-detecting-financial-reporting-fraud, (accessed: 1 March 2017; Cieslewicz, J.K., The fraud model in international contexts: a call to include societal-level influences in the model (2012) Journal of Forensic and Investigative Accounting, 4 (1), pp. 214-254; Cressey, D.R., (1953) Other People’s Money; a Study of the Social Psychology of Embezzlement, , Free Press, New York, NY; Crutchley, C.E., Jensen, M.R.H., Marshall, B.B., Climate for scandal: corporate environments that contribute to accounting fraud (2007) The Financial Review, 42 (1), pp. 53-73; Davis, J.S., Pesch, H.L., Fraud dynamics and controls in organizations (2013) Accounting, Organizations and Society, 38 (6-7), pp. 469-483; Della Porta, D., Vannucci, A., Corruption and anti-corruption: the political defeat of ‘clean hands’ in Italy (2007) West European Politics, 30 (4), pp. 830-853; Dellaportas, S., Conversations with inmate accountants: motivation, opportunity and the fraud triangle (2013) Accounting Forum, 37 (1), pp. 29-39; Dhami, M.K., White-collar prisoners’ perceptions of audience reaction (2007) Deviant Behavior, 28 (1), pp. 57-77; Dorminey, J., Fleming, A.S., Kranacher, M., Riley, R.A., Beyond the fraud triangle (2010) The CPA Journal, 80 (7), pp. 17-23; Dorminey, J., Fleming, A.S., Kranacher, M.-J., Riley, R.A., Jr., The evolution of fraud theory (2012) Issues in Accounting Education, 27 (2), pp. 555-579; Duffield, G.M., Grabosky, P.N., (2001) The Psychology of Fraud, 199. , Australian Institute of Criminology Canberra, Canberra; Efendi, J., Srivastava, A., Swanson, E.P., Why do corporate managers misstate financial statements?

The Law “On State Financial Guarantees for Medical Care of the Population”, adopted by the Parliament in October 19, 2017 introduces the practice of establishing healthcare guarantees in Ukraine. The main reforming measures are defined in “The Program of Activities of the Cabinet Ministers of Ukraine”, they include: 1) changing the concept of financing; 2) the formation of hospital districts; 3) the transformation of healthcare facilities by altered budgeting institutions into communal non-profit enterprises; and 4) other changes related to new principles of public procurements and other anti-corruption measures. Within the medical reform the following measures have already been taken: 1) the number of hospital bed-places decreases in the regions due to the reduction of the number of patients in the regions; 2) the cost of utilities in all hospitals from January 1, 2018 is covered by the local authorities; 3) the formation of hospital districts introduced in the country; 4) since April, 2017 the state program “Available medicines” has begun; 5) on April 25, 2017 the decision was made to introduce new standards of clinical protocols in Ukraine which is based on international standards; 6) since June 19, 2017 the first service of the electronic healthcare system e-Health operates in the pilot mode – “registration of primary healthcare institutions”; and 7) from September 20, 2017 the e-Health system has been working in test mode. © 2019, William S.

Based on this argument, this study was conducted to analyze and evaluate the application of blockchain technology in public procurement. Research Methods: The research method used is a qualitative-descriptive research method with a literature study approach. The Accounting Theory is used as analytical tool, to predict the possibility of using blockchain technology. Results: Result finds that blockchain technology can be used as an alternative tool for supporting good corporate governance mechanism. Blockchain features that do not allow any third party intervention can reduce agency conflict which always arises from the information asymmetry between the principal and the agent, thereby reducing the disparity of power between the government and the citizen, as the source of the agency problem. Future research may use other research methods, such as mixed methods, to get clarity on the root of the problem for combating corruption. © 2019, International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

The article aims to contribute to improvements in public procurement legislation and practice. The article examines the practice of supervisory bodies and assesses the frequency of violations of the principle of transparency. The main findings of the article are that over the years of application of the Public Procurement Act in versions ZJN-2 and ZJN-3, the number of violations of the basic principle of transparency increased - the most frequent violations concerning discriminatory criteria set by the contracting authorities and their implementation in the selection phase - and that local municipal bodies violated the principle of transparency more often than state bodies. © 2019 Matej Kirn et al., published by Sciendo 2019.;Central Government, Municipalities, Principle of Transparency, Public Procurement, Supervision;;"Basta Trtnik, M., Kostanjevec, V., (2016) Zakon O Javnem Narocanju (ZJN-3) S Komentarjem, , Ljubljana: Uradni list RS; Hacek, M., Baclija, I., (2014) Can Small Localities Perform?

This article uses machine learning tools to analyze a large dataset of public contracts from across Europe, in order to identify the conditions under which close connections, defined both in terms of repeated interaction, as well as geographical dispersion, appear. Previous theoretical results suggest that close ties should emerge as an enforcement mechanism in settings characterized by weak outside enforcement, such as those involving corruption. Results from random forest models show support for this hypothesis, along with identifying other structural determinants of the outcome. The most striking finding is that even after accounting for numerous potential confounders, major differences in terms of average diversity levels between countries persist, and these differences map onto an indicator of governance quality and corruption, but not at all on income per capita. These findings point to the centrality of the structure of interactions between private and public actors for understanding governance outcomes. Copyright © V.K.

Ebekozien A.;"57208104712;";Unethical practices in procurement performance of nigerian public building projects: Mixed methods approach;2019;Theoretical and Empirical Researches in Urban Management;14;3;;41;61;;4;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070207778&partnerID=40&md5=78bf87879dbc1a4e5ac18801ed538505;Unethical practices in building projects procurement hinder economic development and social services. Therefore, this paper examined the effect of unethical practices on procurement performance of public building projects and attempts to proffer feasible solutions. The study population comprised governmental institutions, contracting and consultancy firms respectively in Abuja, Nigeria. A sequential explanatory mixed methods approach was adopted. Out of the 150 questionnaires administered, 72 were found suitable for analysis from the 90 questionnaires returned. The quantitative findings were further explained by the qualitative phase with ten experts engaged via snowball. The findings showed that lack of leadership, weak law, fear of unknown and greed were ranked as the causes of unethical practices. Inflated contract sum, bribery and corruption, shoddy construction and collusion tendering were ranked as the effects of unethical practices. The government need to strengthen anti-corruption agencies to tackle corruption head-on, enforce and upholding the rule of law among others as possible ways to mitigate unethical practices. This is because best policy practice is a “non-implementable” policy in a corrupt environment. For there to be enforcement and compliance of the Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2007, corruption should be tackled, followed by an established institutional framework to achieve sustainability. © 2019, Research Centre in Public Administration and Public Services,cademy of Economic Studies, Bucharest, Romania.

Using unique Swedish municipal data from 2009 to 2015, it demonstrates that when one party dominates local politics, noncompetitive outcomes from public procurement processes are more common. What is most striking is that the risk of receiving only one bid, on what is intended to be an open and competitive tender, considerably increases with long-standing one-party rule. The article contributes to a significant body of work on the detrimental effects of low political competition, and the results are particularly interesting from a comparative perspective because Sweden—an old democracy with a meritocratic bureaucracy, characterized by low levels of corruption and clientelism—is a highly unlikely case in which to find such tendencies. © The Author(s) 2019.;bureaucracies, corruption and patronage, local politics, political competition, political economy, political parties, public procurement, Sweden;;"Acemoglu, D., Robinson, J., (2012) Why nations fail: The origins of power, prosperity, and poverty, , New York, NY, Random House Digital; Alt, J., Lassen, D., The political economy of institutions and corruption in American states (2003) Journal of Theoretical Politics, 15, pp. 341-365; Amore, M.D., Bennedsen, M., The value of local political connections in a low-corruption environment (2013) Journal of Financial Economics, 110, pp. 387-402; Audet, D., Government procurement: A synthesis report (2002) OECD Journal on Budgeting, 2, pp. 149-194; Becker, G., Stigler, G., Law enforcement, malfeasance, and the compensation of enforces (1974) Journal of Legal Studies, 3, pp. 1-19; Bergh, A., Erlingsson, G., Sjölin, M., Öhrvall, R., (2013) Allmän nytta eller egen vinning?

Design/methodology/approach: The descriptive approach was used in the framework of the presentation and analysis of the concepts of centralized public procurement and decentralized public procurement. The comparative approach was used for presenting some of the experiences of countries in using public procurement methods. The legal approach was also used in the analysis of the legal frameworks governing the public procurement methods in the Arab Republic of Egypt. In addition, the case study methodology was used to study the role of the General Authority for Governmental Services in Egypt in the centralized public procurement processes. Findings: This paper attempts to find the ideal method of public procurement in general and what is the method to be followed in the Egyptian case through the data presented and analysis of the Egyptian public procurement system. Research limitations/implications: This paper attempts to present a model or a theory on how to determine the public procurement methods that should be used in a given country and give sufficient flexibility for the conformity between the two methods upon application depending on the ecological factors of each country. Practical implications: This paper contributes to the development of the public procurement method in the Arab Republic of Egypt by showing the gap between the use of the centralized approach and the decentralized approach at all levels and providing solutions to bridge this gap. Social implications: This paper provides implications to reduce corruption, increase transparency and give the opportunity to the largest number of private shareholders to participate in public procurement. Originality/value: Although there is some literature on centralized and decentralized public procurement, there is a lack or scarcity of research and academic articles on this subject (Patrucco et al., 2017). This paper attempted to do so by filling this gap in this area of research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.";Centralized public procurement, Decentralized public procurement, Public procurement;;"Albano, G.L., Sparro, M., Flexible strategies for centralized public procurement (2010) Review of Economics and Institutions, 1 (2), pp. 1-32; Baldi, S., Vannoni, D., (2014) The impact of centralization, corruption and institutional quality on procurement prices: an application to pharmaceutical purchasing in Italy, , Carlo Alberto Notebooks 379, Torino, December; Brezovnik, B., Oplotnik, Ž.J., Vojinović, B., (De)Centralization of public procurement at the local level in the EU (2015) Transylvanian Review of Administrative Sciences, 4 (46E), pp. 37-52; Carpineti, L., Gustavo, P., Zanza, M., The variety of procurement practice: evidence from public procurement (2006) Handbook of Procurement, pp. 14-46. , Dimitri, N., Piga, G. and Spagnolo, G., and,(Eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; (2006) Building the case for centralisation in public procurement, , www.cips.org/Documents/CIPSAWhitePapers/2006/Building%20the%20case%20for%20centralisation%20in%20public%20procurement.pdf, Melbourne: (accessed, February 10, 2018; (2006), Issued by the General Authority for Governmental Services; Deutsch, D.J., (2013) Centralized procurement versus decentralized procurement, , Memorandum to City Council of Bowie, Bowie, MD, March 9; Johnson, P.F., Leenders, M.R., McCue, C., A comparison of purchasing’s organizational roles and responsibilities in the public and private sector (2003) Journal of Public Procurement, 3 (1), pp. 57-74; Karjalainen, K., (2009) Challenges of purchasing centralization – empirical evidence from public procurement, , ACTA Universities Oeconomica, Based on Essays, Amsterdam, 1-178; Karolis, Š., Vytautas, V., Zinaida, G., Evaluation of financial effects of public procurement centralisation (2011) Journal of Ekonomika, 90 (3), pp. 104-119; (1998), Promulgating the law of organizing tenders and auctions, Official Gazette 19 (Repeated), May 8; Leenders, M.R., Johnson, P.F., (2000) Major structural change in supply organizations, , https://knowledge.capsresearch.org/publications/pdfsprotected/leenders2000.pdf, Center for Advanced Purchasing Studies, Arizona: (accessed, March 20, 2018; (2000) Centralised and decentralised public procurement, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kml60w5dxr1-en, SIGMA Papers 29, OECD Publishing; (2011) Central purchasing bodies, , SIGMA Papers 20, OECD Publishing, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, August; (2011) Centralised purchasing systems in the European Union, , http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kgkgqv703xw-en, SIGMA Papers 47, OECD Publishing, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, April; (2015) Government at a Glance 2015, , OECD Publishing, Paris; (2016) Central purchasing bodies, , SIGMA Papers 20, OECD Publishing; Patrucco, A.S., Luzzini, D., Ronchi, S., Research perspectives on public procurement: content analysis of 14 years of publications in the journal of public procurement (2017) Journal of Public Procurement, 17 (2), pp. 229-269; (2006) Building the Case for Centralisation in Public Procurement, , Australia Pty; (2003) Tonga: operational procurement review, , Report 27342-TG, Washington, DC, June; (2005) The Gambia: country procurement issues papers, , Summary Report 37582, June; Wanyama, P.O., (2010) Fighting corruption in tactical procurement, , theses for the degree of doctor, University of Twente; (2007), Issued by the General Authority for Government Services; (2008), Issued by the General Authority for Government Services; (2016), Issued by the General Authority for Government Services; (1998), Issuing the executive regulation of the law of organizing Tenders and Auctions 89 of 1998, Official Gazette 201, September 6; (1971), Establishing the general authority for governmental services, Official Gazette 35, September 2; (2015), On the achievement of financial and administrative discipline and the raising of the efficiency of government expenditure, Official Gazette 3, January 20; (2017), Official gazette 40, October 7; Islam, T., (2014) Effectiveness of centralized procurement systems in public sector enterprises of Bangladesh: a focus on economic census 2013, , dissertation submittedpartial fulfillment of the requirements for the Degree of MastersProcurement and Supply Management, BRAC Institute of Governance and Development BRAC University";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85068894192

South Africa has over the last few decades followed the international trend of an expanding ‘contract state’. Public procurement is increasingly important to state operational and allocative concerns. South Africa’s public procurement regime is progressively configured into a centrally steered but decentralised organisational form. Inflected through domestic public procurement politics, however, the development of this organisational form has been truncated, with the establishment of only limited central steering capacity producing a public procurement regulatory regime which is weak, fragmented and incoherent, contributing to problems of state incapacity and corruption. In 2013 South Africa’s Minister of Finance announced a major push to reform South Africa’s contract state. The effort aims to better establish, locate and extend public procurement regulatory authority. It has begun to elaborate a centre-led, strategic and increasingly developmental procurement methodology. It is moving towards more flexibility, effectively an attempt to reduce rigidity in rules while building more robust and distributed disciplinary mechanisms, ones which take account of deficits in regulatory capacity and political will. We consider the potentials and pitfalls of these movements and suggest ways to optimise them. © 2019, © 2019 Government Technical Advisory Centre (GTAC).;Procurement, reform, regulation;"corruption; economic reform; post-apartheid; public administration; public spending; reform process; regulatory framework; state role; South Africa";"Adler, G., (2000) Public service labour relations in a democratic South Africa, , Witwatersrand University Press, Johannesburg: (Ed; (2017), http://www.agsa.co.za/Portals/0/Reports/PFMA/201617/GR/AG%20PFMA%202017%20Web%20SMALL.pdf, Consolidated general report on national and provincial audit outcomes; (2017), http://www.agsa.co.za/Portals/0/Reports/MFMA/201617/GR/MFMA2016-17_FullReport.pdf, Consolidated general report on the local government audit outcomes; (1997), http://www.anc.org.za/content/anc-strategy-and-tactics-adopted-50th-national-conference, Strategy and tactics as adopted at the 50th national conference; Arendse, P., (2013), Project report: Comparative benchmark research on international public procurement legal frameworks.

It embraces the active involvement of multiple stakeholders. Intricacies of procurement process, close interactions among public officials, businesses, and a multitude of stakeholders make procurement process analysis and modeling a complex exercise. Bearing this in mind, the present research aims to identify risks in public procurement and uncover the potential contributors and their interrelationships. The proposed methodology integrates grounded theory with fault tree and failure mode effects and criticality analysis techniques. The results identify several corruption risk factors and rank them according to their criticality. Interestingly, 45 combinations of risk elements were identified that may lead to unfair contract award. It also deduces important practical insights for strengthening organizational corruption controls and improving procurement processes. Further, this model contributes in opening up future research avenues for conducting improved risk assessment. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;corruption, government contracting, internal controls;;"Aldrich, H.E., (1999) Organizations evolving, , Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications; Amemba, C.S., Nyaboke, P.G., Osoro, A., Mburu, N., Challenges Affecting Public Procurement Performance Process in Kenya (2015) IEJBM, 7 (7), pp. 271-280; Andersson, S., Erlingsson, New management and risks of corruption: The case of Sweden (2012) The social construction of corruption in Europe, pp. 33-57. , A.

This paper adds to the evidence, using data on 34,000 firms from the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys, in 90 countries with procurement systems data from Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments. We find that in countries with better public access to complete, reliable, and timely procurement information, firms are more likely to participate in public procurement markets. Firms report paying less in kickbacks to officials in countries where exceptions to open competition in tendering must be explicitly justified, and where there are effective and independent complaints mechanisms. These findings - particularly on kickbacks - are robust to the inclusion of numerous controls and to a range of sensitivity tests. However, due to data limitations we are unable to rule out the possibility that these estimates may reflect in part endogeneity bias. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

As a result, online evaluation is widely used in modern society where it is common to see work remotely. In Korea, Public Procurement Service and the Ministry of SMEs and Startups are used as representative. If the online evaluation is performed by the Public Procurement Service, video evaluation is performed in the same way as offline face-to-face evaluation, but the sincerity of the evaluation committee can be a problem on-line. Thus, Public Procurement Service administrator individually measured the sincerity according to the assessor's The Absent Detection Rate. However, in this paper, we implemented the Absent Detection System for Online Integrity Evaluation using Spark and OpenCV technology to automatically measure the Absent Detection Rate. This allows us to measure the integrity of our members more accurately and efficiently. © BEIESP.;Big Data, Online Evaluation, OpenCV, Spark, The Absent Detection;;"(2015) Introduction of Proposal and Proposal Evaluation, , rfp.g2b.go.kr; (2017) Public Procurement Service; (2017) Public Procurement Service; Eun, J.H., Kim, T.H., Lee, S.W., Jung, C.H., Jung, H.M., (2014) Next Generation Real Time Big Data Distribution System Trends -Focused on Sparks and Storms -, Information and Communication Technology Promotion Center, Weekly Technology Trend; (2018), spark.apache.org; Jung, Y.G., Ji, S.Y., (2014) Journal of Communications of the Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineers, pp. 15-21; Jang, H., (2016) Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence, Information and Communication Technology Promotion Center, Weekly Technology Trends, pp. 14-23; (2018), opencv.org";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85068517453

The purpose of this paper is to find out, what the main factors are in Slovakia that are influencing public procurement efficiency, and based on our analysis, we will also estimate what is the impact of each factor on the efficiency of public procurement in Slovakia. The research for this paper was executed in three stages. We began with a small number of face-to-face in-depth interviews with specialist procurement advisors to contracting authorities. In the second stage, we created draft questionnaires for contracting authorities and for suppliers, and once we tested questionnaires, it was sent to 13,571 suppliers and to 4,300 contracting authorities. In the last stage, we used various types of analyses to examine identified factors. There is significant agreement between suppliers and contractors that the two main factors causing inefficiencies are excessive bureaucracy and corruption or other ethical shortcomings. It is shown that insufficient competition, and the excessive use of the lowest price criterion for selecting winning bids, add further inefficiencies. Savings are greatest when there are between 6 and 8 bidders. E-auctions generally produce larger savings than more traditional methods, but Slovak procurement procedures are costly, compared to most other EU states. This paper contributes to the understanding of what are the core factors which may influence public procurement efficiency. It also provides valuable information for government officials on how to change public procurement rules in order to achieve higher efficiency. © 2019 Matus Grega et al., published by Sciendo 2019.;Efficiency, Public Procurement, Slovakia;;"Afonso, A., Schuknecht, L., Tanzi, V., (2006) Public Sector Effi ciency: Evidence for New EU Member States and Emerging Markets, , Working Paper 581, Európska Centrálna Banka; Akerlof, G.A., The market for 'lemons': Quality, uncertainty and the market mechanism (1970) The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 84 (3), pp. 488-500; Bandiera, O., Prat, A., Valletti, T., (2008) Active and Passive Waste in Government Spending: Evidence from a Policy Experiment.

It involves both elites in bending rules and laws as well as police at the bottom of the hierarchy asking for bribes. We analyze corruption intentions within the framework of Brennan and Pettit’s “economy of esteem,” using three main conceptual frameworks: attachment to kinship groups, materialistic orientations, and deterrence. We draw on data from a survey of 530 university students in Ghana to examine predictors of corruption intentions of prospective elites. Our prospective elites were more inclined to resort to influence peddling rather than to pay bribes directly. We find that attitudinal patterns indicative of esteem predict intentions to engage in corrupt exchanges across different agencies and contexts—police, procurement for government, and abuse of power—as well as different types of action, whether bribe payment or nepotism. In contrast, citizenly pride (and self-esteem) motivates integrity across all types of corrupt exchange. Deterrence, in terms of certainty, had a more consistently negative impact on intentions to engage in nepotism than in bribe paying and acceptance, with public procurement being the exception; no effect was found for stigma, and only police nepotism was an exception to the otherwise non-significant effects of severity. © 2018 Georgia State University.";corruption, deterrence, economy of esteem, materialism, primordialism;;"Abotchie, C., (1997) Social control in traditional Southern Eweland of Ghana: Relevance for modern crime prevention, , Accra, Ghana, Ghana Universities Press; Armantier, O., Boly, A., A controlled field experiment on corruption (2011) European Economic Review, 55, pp. 1072-1082; Assimeng, M.J., (1999) Social structure of Ghana: A study in persistence and change, , Accra, Ghana, Ghana; (2017) Rolls-Royce apologies after £671 m bribery settlement, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38644114, Retrieved January 20, 2017, from, (, a; (2017) Why piles of cash keep turning up in Nigeria, , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-39695637, Retrieved April 26, 2017, from, (, b; Becker, G.S., Stigler, G.J., Law enforcement, malfeasance, and compensation of enforcers (1974) The Journal of Legal Studies, 3, pp. 1-18; Belk, R.W., Three scales to measure constructs related to materialism: Reliability, validity, and relationships to measures of happiness (1984) NA-Advances in Consumer Research, 11, pp. 291-297; Bohn, S., Justifying corrupt exchanges: Rational-choice corruptors (2013) Zeitschrift für Vergleichende Politikwissenschaft, 7, pp. 159-182; Bottoms, A.E., von Hirsch, A., The crime-preventive impact of penal sanctions (2010) The oxford handbook of empirical legal research, , Cane P., Kritzer H., (eds), Oxford, England, Oxford University Press, (Eds; Brennan, G., Pettit, P., (2004) The economy of esteem: An essay on civil and political society, , Oxford, England, Oxford University Press; Brownsberger, W.N., Development and governmental corruption—Materialism and political fragmentation in Nigeria (1983) The Journal of Modern African Studies, 21, pp. 215-233; Cupit, G., When does justice require impartiality (2000) London: Political Studies Association-UK 50th Annual Conference, pp. 10-13. , In, April (., –; (2015) Bribery scandal rocks judiciary, , http://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/bribery-scandal-rocks-judiciary.html, Retrieved February 7, 2017, from; (2016) Smarttys Make Final Payment of Refund for Bus Branding, , https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/smarttys-make-final-payment-of-refund-for-bus-branding.html, Retrieved September 10, 2018, from; De Sardan, O.J., A moral economy of corruption in Africa?

Adopting e-filing systems reduces tax compliance costs as measured by the time to prepare and pay taxes, the likelihood and frequency of firms being visited by a tax official, and the perception of tax administration as an obstacle to firms' operation and growth. E-filing is also associated with a moderate increase in the income tax revenue to GDP ratio. The results for e-procurement are weaker, with the number of firms securing or attempting to secure a government contract increasing only in countries with higher levels of development and better institutions. There is no strong relationship between e-government and corruption. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

The participation at the public procurement tenders result the information exchange between the competitors therefore lead to the market closure and increased prices for the end-users. Enforcement of anti-corruption laws have risen, including the imposition of huge fines for the enterprises, and prison sentences for offending corporate executives. The purpose of this article is to analyse and evaluate the factors resulting corruption actions in the energy sector and to reveal the intercourse between the competition law regulation and corruption regulation. The data collection, systemic review and other methods were used. Key findings reveal that corruption occurs due to the specifics of the sector as the resource location, politics, and public procurement. Significance of this research is high due to increased impact of the energy resources to daily life and the monopolistic undertakings resulting high prices to the consumers. Recommendations to minimise the corruption probability highlights the importance of the increased level of transparency and prevention mechanisms especially in the vulnerable areas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;Competition, Corruption, Energy, Public sector, Risk assessment, Undertakings;"Competition; Costs; Energy policy; Energy resources; Risk assessment; Corporate executives; Corruption; Energy; Information exchanges; Issues and challenges; Public procurement; Public sector; Undertakings; Crime; competition (economics); corruption; energy resource; public sector; regulatory framework; resource management; risk assessment; state role";"Banks, F.E., World Scientific Series on Energy and Resources Economics – Vol. 2: The Political Economy of World Energy, An Introductory Textbook (2007), World Scientific Publishing Singapore; Bellis, V.B., Competition Law of the European Community (2010), Kluwer Law International Netherlands; Case T-25/1995 a.o.

The authors, two law professors based at the University of Copenhagen, show how public procurement policy and practices link various elements of the capital city hub and advance human rights, anti-corruption, labor movement and environmental goals. Many of the procedures implemented in Copenhagen are derived from EU procurement guidelines and city officials counter efforts to water them down in coordination with NGOs, universities, media and other hub components. All of these actions generate strong demand for sustainability policies from the public. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Robert W.

In a particularly delicate historical moment in which professional bodies and associations claim their identity and their role by carrying out with force and determination the specific mission, in contrast to people wich called also recently for their suppression and for the consequent simultaneous liberalization of professions, arguing both the service poor quality and the lack of adequate guarantees for members, the work focuses attention on some profiles connected to the legal nature and to the specific mission entrusted to them. Confirming the notion, the meaning and the effects deriving from the qualification of «public body», the study re-evaluates the double legitimacy of professional association and bodies to challenge harmful measures in their own right and in the interest of the members, highlighting that the conflict the conflict of interests with every professional or member taking advantage of the disputed act generally does not impede such legitimacy, wich is exclusively hindered by the problems concerning the activities falling within the professional’s or member discipline, prerogatives and powers. The study admits that the professional associations have the power to charge the managers with the crime referred to in article 323 of the Italian Criminal Code and underlines the consequences deriving from the misappropriation of the funds payed by the members to finance activities being extraneous to the Entity activity, to pursuit purposes different from the institutional ones or to favor the perpetration of irregularity, illegitimacy and/or other illicit. Finally, the research focuses on transparency, fairness and good faith requirements in public procurement, in the light of mutual relations between the exponential bodies, the other Public Authorities and National Anti-Corruption Authority, recognizing that in presence of particularly serious and evident provision defects undermining the trust placed by the professional in charge, the failure by the professional association to adjudicate in the request for review constitutes a negligent conduct, wich is contrary to the fondamental rules of public Authorities correctness and good performance adversely affecting the principle of loyal cooperation. Nevertheless, it has to be underestimated the propulsive stimulating role to the control the acts adopted by the other Public Authorities carried out by the National Anti-Corruption Authority, wich essentially consists in the power to affect the quality of administrative act, also with the aim to reduce the administrative litigation. © 2019, University of Urbino.

Looking back over the last 200 years, the book demonstrates that Argentina has historically addressed corruption through ineffective debates between public-private biases or a cultural-criminal approach reinforced by modernization theory, neither of which have helped tackle the problem. Instead, Volosin proposes meaningful institutional reforms to reduce opportunities for corruption and to increase monitoring incentives and capabilities. The book argues that political economy hindrances for reform are as significant as reform itself and shows that in times of crisis or scandal, the need to move quickly to satisfy citizen demands forces politicians to promote unplanned changes that lack real teeth. Moreover, the machines reach over most public and private actors precludes regime-undermining reform, which is precisely what is needed to meaningfully attack entrenched structural corruption. In order to combat serious deficits in the public procurement regime, Volosin recommends a micro-sectorial analysis of government procurement, supported by an innovative human rights strategy to help measure and disclose corruptions hidden social cost, raise awareness, integrate vulnerability criteria into the fight against corruption, and employ local, regional, and international litigation and monitoring tools to compel the political branches to perform structural change. This innovative exploration into corruption in Argentina will be of interest to researchers working on public policy, administrative law, anticorruption studies, law and development, and governance both in Argentina, and beyond. © 2020 Natalia A.

Companies invest considerable effort in putting compliance programmes in place and ensuring that they are effective. Such companies often express scepticism as to the added benefit other anti-corruption efforts, such as Integrity Pacts, can bring. This paper seeks to explore whether, as argued, the Integrity Pact approach duplicates corporate compliance programmes, or, is complementary of them. Drawing on experiences emerging from a pilot project underway in eleven countries in the European Union, the paper concludes that Integrity Pacts can bring a range of benefits that complement compliance programmes and can help address common gaps including supporting in managing risks, delivering training and demonstrating appropriate tone from the top. On this basis it recommends that firms should take a broader view of Integrity Pacts when assessing whether to integrate them into their compliance efforts. © 2019, Lexxion Verlagsgesellschaft mbH.

Despite clear legislation, corruption in the selection of suppliers is often noted. In order to bring more transparency to the process, as well as to minimize the possibility of corruption, the use of public e-procurement systems is growing. In this context, specifically in the Brazilian case, an agent-based negotiation model is proposed to automate the negotiation and selection of suppliers in the electronic purchasing modality. The model is composed of procedures to measure the utility of proposal; generate counterproposals through concession tactics; and to choose the most appropriate supplier, according to the utility of proposals at the end of the negotiation. A negotiation simulation was performed in an instance of the acquisition of a product by a Brazilian university. It was possible to verify the applicability of the model and evaluate the impact of the parameters in the result of the negotiation process. © INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING.";Agent-based negotiation, E-procurement, Negotiation, Public procurement;"Crime; Agent based; e-Procurement; E-procurement systems; Negotiation; Negotiation models; Negotiation process; Public procurement; Intelligent agents";"Aknine, S., A multi-agent model for overlapping negotiation (2012) Group Decision and Negotiation, 21 (6), pp. 747-790; Andersen, T.B., E-Government as an anti-corruption strategy (2009) Information Economics and Policy, 21 (3), pp. 201-210; Baarslag, T., (2016) Exploring the Strategy Space of Negotiating Agents: A Framework for Bidding, Learning and Accepting in Automated Negotiation., , Springer, Switzerland; Barahona, J.C., Elizondo, A.M., Introducing a disruptive service innovation: A national dilemma in e- Procurement (2014) Management Decision, 52 (9), pp. 1782-1800; Barron, F.H., Barrett, B.E., Decision quality using ranked attribute weights (1996) Management Science, 42 (11), pp. 1515-1523; Costa, A.A., Arantes, A., Tavares, L.V., Evidence of the impacts of public e-procurement: The Portuguese experience (2013) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 19 (4), pp. 238-246; Edwards, W., Barron, F.H., SMARTS and SMARTER: Improved simple methods for multiattribute utility measurement (1994) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 60 (3), pp. 306-325; Elbahnasawy, N.G., E-Government, internet adoption, and corruption: An empirical investigation (2014) World Development, 57, pp. 114-126; Faratin, P., Sierra, C., Jennings, N.R., (1998) Negotiation Decision Functions for Autonomous Agents.

Using mainly the evidence of Hungary and Poland the paper analyses one of the potential reasons of this strategic turn: the struggle between political elites. One elite was bound to the strong presence of multinational business and the institutions of the ‘competition state’. Their positions were challenged by another political elite that allied mainly with local bourgeoisie. One main arena of conflicts is the economy where political elites try to widen their influence in order to gain financial support. New forms of rent-seeking and corruption became possible after the V4 accession to the European Union (EU) when the flow of financial aid increased. Aid was channelled to partisan firms in public procurement tenders that made legal corruption possible. Political and social control over this practice declined with the demise of classic program parties’ role in politics and the raise of populist ‘business firm’ political parties. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Since it almost always focuses on the prediction of corrupt competition, the calculation of various indices and indications of corruption to the data itself are very difficult to come by. These data sets usually have very few observations, especially accurately labelled ones. The prevention or detection of compromised public procurement processes is definitely a crucial step, related to the initial phase of public procurement, i.e., the phase of publication of the notice. The aim of this paper is to compare prediction models using text-mining techniques and machine-learning methods to detect suspicious tenders, and to develop a model to detect suspicious one-bid tenders. Consequently, we have analyzed tender documentation for particular tenders, extracted the content of interest about the levels of all bids and grouped it by procurement lots using machine-learning methods. A model that includes the aforementioned components uses the most common text classification algorithms for the purpose of prediction: naive Bayes, logistic regression and support vector machines. The results of the research showed that knowledge in the tender documentation can be used for detection suspicious tenders. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Gottschalk P.;"7005252180;";Application of the theory of convenience to a case of illegal public procurement of healthcare services;2019;International Journal of Procurement Management;12;6;;621;631;;;10.1504/IJPM.2019.102937;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073634280&doi=10.1504%2fIJPM.2019.102937&partnerID=40&md5=8d47f943fb253d18419d96b5f876bed3;We address the following research question in this article: how can convenience theory in terms of motive, opportunity, and willingness explain deviant behaviour in the case of public procurement of healthcare services in a Norwegian municipality? This research is important, as it can identify motives at the individual and organisational level, opportunities at the organisational and societal level, and willingness at the individual level, even when there is not necessarily corruption involved. The application of convenience theory is by no means an excuse for violations of laws and regulations. Rather, this article demonstrates where prevention of misconduct and crime needs attention. It is particularly at the organisational level, where opportunity structures tend to enable commitment and concealment of illegitimate financial transactions. When auditing and other forms of control are de facto absent, where the blame game occurs, and where it is impossible to trace events because documents and e-mails have disappeared, then misconduct and crime become convenient options.

The proposed modifications to the agency model define a new approach to regulatory impact assessment. In the case of two bidders, the restrictions on criteria number and scoring weights are identified. The paper discusses several reasons to consider the quality of scoring rule as a critical success factor at procurement stage of public-private partnership projects as well for public procurement itself.

Best practices based on the Public Procurement Act 663 and Act 914 which are in line with ISO 15489-1 standards were adopted as a benchmark and compared with existing practices. A multiple case study strategy was used to compare the results of literature synthesis on procurement records management with the existing situation in three selected public entities to establish a trend. Four main gaps were identified, namely, fragmentation of files; different department keeping the fragmented files; unavailability of certain required records; and difference between process file name and number in comparison with the process name and number in procurement plans. These gaps have reduced process transparency and accountability and have downplayed the integrity of procurement processes fostering corruption.

In this study, the state losses in government-funded construction projects in Indonesia is analyzed. Research data were collected through field observations for types of work that were not completed per technical specifications. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. The results indicate that structural work was responsible for 98.70% of total state losses. The top three state losses were found to be associated with concrete, roads, and front stonework, and the values are 40.40%, 28.43%, and 18.23% respectively. Loss in architectural work was the smallest (1.30%). The outcomes of this survey offer a knowledge basis for law enforcement authorities and construction project supervisors to pay more attention to projects involving concrete structures, rigid pavement structures during road construction, and stonework. © 2019 by the authors.;Corruption, Infrastructure project, State financial losses;;"(1999) of The Republic of Indonesia Number 31, Year 1999 Regarding Eradication of Criminal Acts of Corruption, , The Government Republic of Indonesia: Jakarta, Indonesia; (2001) of The Republic of Indonesia Number 20, Year 2001 Regarding Eradication of Criminal Acts of Corruption, , Government Republic of Indonesia: Jakarta, Indonesia; (2002) of The Republic of Indonesia Number 30, Year 2002 Regarding Commission of Criminal Acts of Corruption, , Government Republic of Indonesia: Jakarta, Indonesia; (2004) of the President of the Republic of Indonesia Number 59, Year 2004 Regarding Formation of Court of Justice for Criminal Acts of Corruption within the District Court of Central Jakarta, , Government Republic of Indonesia: Jakarta, Indonesia; (2009) of The Republic of Indonesia Number 46, Year 2009 Regarding Court of Justice for Criminal Acts of Corruption, , Government Republic of Indonesia: Jakarta, Indonesia; (2010) of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia Number 191/KMA/SK/XII/2010 Regarding Formation of Court of Justice for Criminal Acts of Corruption within the District Court of Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya, , The Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia: Jakarta, Indonesia; (2011) of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia Number 22/KMA/SK/II/2011 Regarding Formation of Court of Justice for Criminal Acts of Corruption within the District Court of Medan, Padang, Pekanbaru, Palembang, Tanjung Karang, Serang, Yogyakarta, Banjarmasin, Pontianak, Samarinda, Makassar, Mataram, Kupang and Jayapura, , The Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia: Jakarta, Indonesia; (2011) of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia Number 153/KMA/SK/X/2011 Regarding Formation of Court of Justice for Criminal Acts of Corruption within the District Court of Banda Aceh, Tanjung Pinang, Jambi, Pangkal Pinang, Bengkulu, Palangkaraya, Mamuju, Palu, Kendari, Manado, Gorontalo, Denpasar, Ambon, Ternate and Manokwari, , The Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia: Jakarta, Indonesia; Prabowo, H.Y., Sight beyond sight: Foreseeing corruption in the Indonesian government through behavioral analysis (2016) J.

Diseño de indicadores de medición];2019;CIRIEC-Espana Revista de Economia Publica, Social y Cooperativa;;96;;253;280;;6;10.7203/CIRIEC-E.96.12627;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070752081&doi=10.7203%2fCIRIEC-E.96.12627&partnerID=40&md5=6f0c9684a24eaf4c00436887d8209676;"The European Union recognizes the importance of public procurement as one of the instruments that must be used to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. In Spain, Law 9/2017, of November 8, on Public Sector Contracts, transposes the European Parliament and Council Directives 2014/23 / EU and 2014/24 / EU into the Spanish legal system. This law aims to incorporate transversally socially responsible criteria when preparing and executing public contracts. In addition, it obliges bidding companies to meet specific requirements on gender equality, fair labor conditions, fair trade consumption or energy efficiency. Specifically, the basic objectives pursued by the Law are; the impartiality and objectivity of procedures, greater transparency in public procurement and improving the quality- price ratio. All this means guaranteeing the correctness of the procedures, avoiding any hint of corruption and using public procurement in a strategic manner to implement, with the resources that are managed through the contracts, public policies at communitarian and national levels in the social, environmental, and development fields and the innovation and promotion of the participation of small and medium enterprises in public procurement. Faced with this situation, public administrations have begun to develop guidelines and approve instructions for the implementation of socially responsible clauses in their hiring. However, despite its importance, there is no specific measurement instrument that evaluates this type of behavior. In this context, we propose this research with the aim of facilitating a tool, composed of a series of ethical and sustainable indicators, in line with the new Law, which allow comparative measurement and comparison of the responsible behavior of administrations in relation to their public contracts. In this way, the contracting bodies must present in their specifications concrete measures to guarantee, on the one hand, integrity in their contracting procedures and, on the other hand, the strategic use of their contracts. All this it will allow to implement, with the resources that are managed through contracts, national and international policies in social, environmental, promotion of innovation and of the participation of small and medium enterprises in public procurement. The research has revealed the existence of numerous guides and publications for the implementation of social, ethical and environmental clauses in public procurement, as well as instructions or agreements on sustainable public procurement. Specifically, in Spain, there are many administrations that, in recent years, have published good practice guides for the inclusion of Social Responsibility clauses in their contracts. In addition, it has been observed the continued existing commitment of the Spanish public administrations with the Social Responsibility, through the approval of Agreements or Instructions. Indeed, since 2005, in which the Good Governance Code of the General State Administration was approved in Spain, and in 2009, when the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces approved its own Code of Good Governance, very significant steps have been taken in terms of Social Responsibility and sustainability. In the second stage of the study, a series of social and environmental indicators were created to evaluate and compare responsible practices in public procurement throughout the different phases of the contract (preparation, awarding, execution). This first investigation has some limitations derived from the lack of quantitative data, however, like any exploratory study, it constitutes a hypothesis-generating element and serves as the basis for future investigations that allow evaluating the hiring of the entities that make up the public sector in relationship to social, environmental and ethical issues. At the same time, this proposal may favor focusing the practices and responsible policies to address the observed shortcomings, contributing to obtain economic and social environmental benefits, for the Administration and for the private sector and society in general. According to the objectives formulated in this exploratory study, it has been proven that, increasingly and with a general nature, public administrations are aware and are concerned about the aspects that have to do with Transparency, Social Responsibility and sustainability. From the analysis of the current situation of sustainable public procurement, the important efforts of the initiatives, both national and international, aimed at strengthening a regulatory framework in this area are confirmed. Specifically, in Spain, it is observed that there are many administrations that adopt the commitment to be socially responsible in their hiring. However, the great task that remains to be done to adapt to the regulatory framework in these matters has been verified. The importance of this work, because it is a pioneer, is that it has defined a series of indicators that serve to evaluate sustainability in public procurement. In addition, the proposed indicators allow to guide the implementation of good practices and can be used in future research as a basic methodological instrument to advance in the understanding and improvement of sustainable public procurement processes. All this will allow knowing the current situation of sustainable public procurement and being able to compare them over time, evaluate the impact of the approval of procurement laws in local administrations, determine good practices in public procurement, measure the effects of instructions or agreements on public procurement, identify if there are patterns of behavior among public administrations in relation to their responsible contracting and what could be the conditioning factors of sustainable practices in public procurement. © 2012 Universitat de València.";Indicators, Social and environmental clauses, Social responsibility, Sustainable public procurement;;"Aldeguer, B., ética Pública y Gobierno Local en un contexto de crisis económica (2013) Barataria, 15, pp. 15-37; Brammer, S., Walker, H., Sustainable procurement in the public sector: an international comparative study (2011) International Journal of Operations & Production Management, 31 (4), pp. 452-476. , https://doi.org/10.1108/01443571111119551; Brugué, J., Modernizar la administración desde la izquierda: burocracia, nueva gestión pública y administración deliberativa (2004) Revista del CLAD Reforma y Democracia, 29, pp. 1-16; Burzaco, S.M., Contrataciones públicas socialmente responsables: la necesidad de reconsiderar el potencial de la contratación pública en la consecución de objetivos sociales (2016) CIRIECEspaña, Revista de Economía Pública, Social y Cooperativa, 86, pp. 281-310; Canales, J.M., ""Algunas reflexiones sobre los principales problemas y desafíos pendientes en la innovación de las Administraciones Publicas"" (2003) Nuevos Retos en el Horizonte de las Administraciones Públicas, , http://www.um.es/gap/nuevos_retos_en_el_horizonte_de_las_AAPP.pdf, En: Fernández, M., Sierra, J. y Valero, J.

Starting from a contextualization about the meaning and impact of big data and the technology of data analytics in the public sector, six experiences are presented conducted by the Comptroller General's Office (CGU), the main audit body of the Brazilian government, of data mining and predictive analytics used to prevent risks, irregularities and fraud in public procurement and contracts. In general, these initiatives allowed an optimization of the human and organizational resources involved in the audit activity, prioritizing situations in which potential irregularities were, detected. The article also emphasizes that, despite the legitimate purpose of administrative efficiency, the practice of data mining, using big data, must be compatible with the principles of due process of law, public transparency and the protection of the fundamental rights. of citizens, especially the protection of their personal data. © 2019, Revista General de Derecho Administrativo.

The openness of information of key public finance authorities has a powerful anti-corruption effect and has a beneficial effect on economic development, while transparency of public finances is a factor in the successful implementation of the reform of all spheres of the economy. The purpose of the article is to develop a methodology for assessing the institutional and political transparency of the leading public finance authorities in Ukraine and its practical application on the example of the Ministry of Finance and the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine. The methodology includes six main stages, based on which the transparency index of public finance authorities was calculated. Constant calculations of the index will motivate the interaction of stakeholders and non-governmental organizations to increase the openness of public finance authorities in public finances, and the digital data settlements themselves can be used to develop recommendations to increase the level of transparency of the activities of key public finance authorities. Approbation of the developed transparency index of public finance authorities on the example of the Ministry of Finance and the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine made it possible to calculate the percentage of openness of data published by the indicated institutions. Based on quantitative calculations, practical recommendations were made for improving the completeness, reliability, availability and timeliness of published information. © Alina Bukhtiarova, Yuliia Dukhno, Ganna Kulish, Iryna Kurochkina, Volodymyr Lypchanskyi, 2019;Information openness, Ministry of Finance of Ukraine, Open data, Public administration, Public finances, Public procurement, State Fiscal Service of Ukraine, Transparency, Transparency index;;"Alt, J., Lowry, R., Transparency and accountability: Empirical results for US states (2010) Journal of Theoretical Politics, 22 (4), pp. 379-406. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0951629810375641; Balkin, J.M., (1999) How Mass Simulate Political Transparency, , https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/259/, Retrieved from; Bukhtiarova, A.H., Kibenko, E.O., Innovat-siini prohramy zabezpechennia prozorosti publichnykh finansiv] (2018) Economics and Society, 16, pp. 694-699. , http://economyandsociety.in.ua/journal-16/23-stati-16/2059-bukhtiarova-a-g-kibenko-e-o, Інноваційні програми забезпечення прозорості публічних фінансів; Buriak, A.V., Tsiavuk, A.O., Yemtseva, K.Yu., Teoretychni aspekty transparentnosti bankiv Ukrainy] (2017) Bulletin of the Odessa National University, 22 (4), pp. 97-101. , http://nbuv.gov.ua/UJRN/Vonu_econ_2017_22_4_22, Теоретичні аспекти транспарентності банків України; (2019) Open Data Leaders Network [FSE Shukaye Innovatsiinykh Lideriv Sered Mist Ukrainy Dlia Uchasti V Open Data Leaders Network], , http://eef.org.ua/fsye-shukaye-innovatsijnyh-lideriv-sered-mist-ukrayiny-dlya-uchasti-v-open-data-leaders-network/, ФСЄ шукає інноваційних лідерів серед міст України для участі в; [Sys-Temu Prozorro Otsenyly V EBRR], , https://finclub.net/news/sistemu-prozorro-otsenili-v-ebrr.html, ).

For this reason, the detection of anomalies in public procurements can improve the quality of purchases, and consequently enable a better quality of life in the country through the correct use of public funds. In this paper, we use as a case study the public contracts of Paraguay, which are in the open data format of the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS), for training an unsupervised learning model for anomaly detection, based on the Isolation Forest algorithm. The resulting classification allows to obtain a measurement or scoring of contracts that can be used to identify outliers. Given a local dataset of cases of procurement processes with protests with judgments in favor of the protestant or with citizen complaints, the preliminary results show that the trained model classifies as anomalous more than 45% of the potentially anomalous dataset. A detailed validation considering the public procurements local regulations is needed, with the purpose of building a tool that allows an intelligent sampling of contracts with atypical behavior to review, applicable to Paraguay and other countries that implement the OCDS. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

The formal rules that determine conduct of economic entities in this field tend to be an essential factor underlying development of an efficient competitive environment in the public procurement quasi-market, which, other conditions being equal, facilitates growth of well-being for both consumers and producers in Russia. The paper focuses on the evolution of auction technologies and the underlying legal and regulatory framework in the modern Russia. A detailed comparative analysis of various auctions methods used in public procurement in Russia is presented to highlight the rationale of their transformation. Some formal rules are highlighted that contributed to attaining a controlled uniformity of procurement mechanisms, which have led to better predictability and attractiveness of the new market for its participants, and shaped framework for fighting corruption in the public sector. The pressing factors of corruption and quality assurance in public procurement are addressed. The issue is becoming of particular importance since, due to its current administrative reform, Russia is reviewing its offer for joining the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement. The sequence of technological measures in public and municipal procurement, stages and timeline of procurement procedures are detailed. The role of digitalizing public procurement in order to enhance transparency in this segment of economic operations is discussed. The authors have performed a comparative analysis of different types of e-auctions within the federal regulatory environment in Russia. Any robustness and balance improvement in procurement procedure selection can be expected only after mandatory and synchronous electronification of all methods of public procurement in the Russian Federation. © 2014-2019 Terra Economicus.Использование редукционов при государственных закупках стало важным эта- пом, определяющим современное лицо российской государственной контрактной системы. Формальные правила, определяющие поведение экономических агентов в этой сфере, стали существенным фактором формирования эффективной конку- рентной среды квазирынка государственных закупок, что при прочих равных услови- ях способствует росту благосостояния как потребителей, так и производителей в стране. В статье представлена эволюция аукционных технологий и соответству- ющего нормативно-правового регулирования в современной России. В результате детализированного сравнительного анализа разных методов проведения аукционов в системе российских госзакупок выявлена логика трансформации аукционных тех- нологий. Показаны формальные правила, которые внесли вклад в достижение кон- тролируемого единообразия механизмов осуществления закупочной деятельности, что позволило обеспечить большую предсказуемость и привлекательность нового рынка для участников, создало рамочные условия и предпосылки для борьбы с кор- рупцией в государственном секторе. Рассмотрены факторы коррупциогенности и обеспечения качества в сфере госзакупок. Это имеет особое значение в условиях под- готовки к присоединению РФ к Соглашению ВТО о государственных закупках. В работе приводится последовательность технологических мероприятий государственных и муниципальных закупок, этапы и сроки проведения закупочных процедур. Показана роль электронизации в повышении прозрачности данной сферы хозяйствования. Приводится сравнительный анализ разновидностей электронного аукциона, встре- чавшихся в рамках федеральной нормативной базы РФ. Ожидания роста сбаланси- рованности при выборе закупочных процедур возможны только после обязательной и единовременной электронизации всех способов государственных закупок в России.";Auction, Economic policy, Effectiveness of the contractual system, Government regulation, Public procurement, Аукцион, Государственное регу- лирование, Государственные закупки, Экономическая политика, Эффективность контрактной системы;;"Anchishkina, O., Contract institutions in the Russian economy: The sphere of state, municipal and regulated procurement (2017) Voprosy Ekonomiki, (11), pp. 93-110. , (In Russian.); Balaeva, O., Yakiovlev, A., Estimation of costs in Russian public procurement system (2017) International Journal of Public Procurement Management, 10 (1), pp. 70-88; Belokrylov, K., Public procurement reform in Russia: ways to reduce the risk of corruption (2017) International Journal of Applied Business and Economic Research, 15 (8), pp. 127-139; Choi, I., Long and winding road to the government procurement agreement: Korea's accession experience (2003) Options for Global Trade Reform.

The main contribution of the project is the development of a data science-based solution to systematically assist managing authorities to increase the effectiveness and efficiency when analysing fraud and corruption cases. The tool combines descriptive and predictive machine learning models with advanced statistics and visualisations. In this regard, we define a number of specific requirements in terms of questions and data analyses, as well as risk indicators and other anomaly patterns. Each of these requirements will materialize in specific visualisations, reports and dashboards included in the final solution. Several internal and external data sources are analysed and assessed to explore possible irregularities in budget and cash management, public service accounts, salaries, disbursement, grants, subsidies, etc. The project has already resulted in an initial prototype (SALER Analytics) successfully tested by the governing bodies of Valencia, in Spain. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Corruption, Data science, Public procurement;"Budget control; Compensation (personnel); Crime; Data mining; Data Science; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Visualization; Anomaly patterns; Cash Management; Corruption; Effectiveness and efficiencies; External data sources; Governing bodies; Machine learning models; Public procurement; Public administration";"Bertot, J.C., Jaeger, P.T., Grimes, J.M., Using ICTs to create a culture of transparency: E-government and social media as openness and anti-corruption tools for societies (2010) Gov.

N. 90/2014, focusing in particular on their application to healthcare enterprises. The study is conducted from a penalistic perspective, highlighting the relations between prevention and repression, as well as the main constitutional criticality of the norm. The reading of the norm exemplifies the difficulty of reconciling the extremely anticipated moment of the intervention with the heavily incisive (and potentially punitive) content of the measures. A discipline seriously lacking from the point of view of Determinedness is counterbalanced by an extremely large role of the anti-corruption authority, responsible not only to cure its application but also to clarify its contours. The extension of the discipline to healthcare companies, which is critical because it ignores the peculia-rities of the sector that distinguish it clearly from the broader scope of public procurement, also hi-ghlights the tensions between Needs guarantee of essential public interests, including social rights, and those of contrasting crime. The measures in question reveal in this context all the potentials and ambi-guities of their multifunctional nature. To an explanatory introduction on the discipline and its role in the contrast to corruption, it follows the framing within the health sector, then a more detailed analysis of the different normative elements and an overall attempt of reconstruction Of the functions of the norm, in order to bring it back to greater constitutional and systematic coherence. © 2019 Pisa University Press.

Though the Public Procurement Authority has made many strides in the adoption of e-procurement in the Ghanaian Public Sector, the pace for the implementation and adoption is still very slow. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the critical factors for the implementation of e-procurement in Ghana. With the knowledge of these critical factors for e-procurement implementation a survey was conducted involving 60 procurement professionals. The mean score ranking test was then used to determine the factors that were significant to the implementation of e-procurement. The results revealed that availability of internet, power stability, capacity enhancement of procurement officers, availability of infrastructure were important critical factors when it comes to implementation of e-procurement while the mandatory use of e-procurement, technical interoperability budgetary control among others were of less importance. This study therefore evaluates the critical factors for e-procurement implementation in public sectors. The implication is that the finding offers useful factors that will guide the stakeholders and policy makers in e-procurement implementation. It provides practitioners with better understanding of e-procurement environment.

Respondents were interviewed using tools for assessing transparency which were spelt out in five thematic areas. Data obtained was analysed through percentages, mean scores and relative importance indices. Findings show that the average percentage level of compliance with the transparency provisions in Act 663 among the COEs is 77.4%, indicating that the COEs complied with the transparency provisions in the Act 663.

In Europe, European Union (EU) Funds provide a boost to public spending in recipient member states while introducing additional corruption controls. We investigate whether EU Funds increase high-level corruption in the Czech Republic and Hungary in 2009–2012. We analyze newly collected data from over 100,000 public procurement contracts to develop objective corruption risk indicators and link them to agency level data in the public sector. Propensity score matching estimations suggest that EU funds increase corruption risk by up to 34 percent. The negative effects are largely attributable to overly formalistic compliance and EU Funds overriding domestic accountability mechanisms in public organizations entirely dependent on external funds. The policy implications are profound: governments should reduce barriers to market entry by lowering red tape and prevent excessive concentration of funds. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd;Big data, Central and Eastern Europe, corruption, EU funds, public procurement, red tape;;"Beblavy, M., Sičáková-Beblavá, E., The Changing Faces of Europeanisation: How Did the European Union Influence Corruption in Slovakia Before and After Accession?

E-Procurement is more than just a system for making purchases online. Some organisations implement e-procurement and succeed while others fail. The objectives of the study were to establish the status quo of e-procurement in Zimbabwe public Procurement, identify major areas of e- procurement challenges, to establish being faced in Zimbabwe public procurement, and recommend a framework that enhances e-procurement in Zimbabwe. The research involved a case study of State Owned Enterprises in Zimbabwe. A purposive sampling technique was adopted for the study and out of the target number of 60 respondents, 50 questionnaires were validly completed and returned. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS and Microsoft excel presented in tables and figures. From the study, it was revealed that employee competency, inadequate legal framework, inadequate technological infrastructure and security of procurement transaction data were challenges to e-Procurement adoption in the organizations under review. The study recommends continuous training of staffon e-Procurement. In addition, formal recognition backed by legislation of the electronic procurement transactions should be encouraged. Integration of the institutions system and those of the suppliers, demonstration of the positive impact of the systems, and installation of linkages between all Governments agencies should be encouraged. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.;Corruption, E-procurement, Public procurement, Service delivery, State Owned Enterprises;;"Thai, K.V., 'Public Procurement Reexamined.'

In a democratic system it is therefore essential that public offices and institutions retain their legitimacy by being accountable as stewards for the scare public funds. However, in a developing country such as South Africa, it may be difficult to develop and maintain accountable political leadership in a climate that is widely acknowledged to have become corrupt.

Especially in the road construction sector, where the earthworks create significant part of the works, comparing e.g. the price of 1 km of roads often gives misleading results. The paper comprises the complete proposal to modify the scope of information provided by offerors in the public procurements (in the construction industry) allowing the clients to determine easily if the contractors have placed the consistent offers i.e. if the bid prices are not too high and if the lowest bid price is not a dumping price. The Conjugated Triangle Method (CTM) of inconsistent bid detection in construction industry is based on the three inter-related parameters: means of production, time of works, on the value of works. Regardless of the offered price it should match the other two parameters. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.;;"Costs; Construction sectors; Existing systems; Means of productions; Public procurement; Two parameter; Construction industry";"Grzyl, B., Apollo, M., Umowa o roboty budowlane w aspekcie podziału ryzyka stron (2015) Inzynieria Morska i Geotechnika, 6, pp. 838-843; Grzyl, B., Maliszewska-Urbańska, E., Siemaszko, A., Safety of investment process parties in the aspect of construction work contract (2017) Journal of Science of the Gen.

Based on [1, 2, 3] the following four indicators were chosen: the number of offers placed in the tender procedure, the range of bid prices being offered, exactly the same set of offerors in a few tender procedures, repeating ordering the works execution to the same contractor in a given geographical region. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.;;"Construction industry; Contractors; Roads and streets; Collusion detection; General contractors; Public procurement; Road construction";"Anysz, H., Foremny, A., Kulejewski, J., Estimating potential losses of the client in public procurement in case of collusion utilizing a MLP neural networks (2014) Technical Transactions, 1111, pp. 105-118; Capobianco, Y.C.A., Ex Officio Cartel Investigations and the Use of Screens to Detect Cartels (2013) OECD; (2017) Urzad Ochrony Konkurencji i Konsumentów, Zmowy Przetargowe""; Zona, J.D., (1986) Bid-rigging and the Competitive Bidding Process: Theory and Evidence, , Ph.D. Dissertation, State University; Porter, R.H., Zona, J.D., Detection of Bid Rigging in Procurement Auctions (1993) Journal of Political Economy, 1013, pp. 518-538; Lesniak, A., Classification of the Bid/No Bid Criteria-Factor Analysis (2015) Archives of Civil Engineering, 614, pp. 79-88; (2008) Instrukcja Oceny Efektywnosci Ekonomicznej Przedsiewzieć Drogowych i Mostowych Dla Dróg Wojewódzkich, , Instytut Badawczy Dróg i Mostów; Harrington, J., Behavioral screening and the detection of cartels (2006) European Competition Law Annual; (2012) OECD Recommendation of the Council on Fighting Bid Rigging in Public Procurement, , OECD; Bageis, A.S., Fortune, C., Factors affecting the bid/no bid decision in the Saudi Arabian construction contractors (2009) Construction Management and Economics, 271, pp. 53-71; El-Mashaleh, M.S., Decision to bid or not to bid: A data envelopment analysis approach (2010) Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering; Enshassi, A., Mohamed, S., El Karriri, A., Factors affecting the bid/no bid decision in the Palestinian construction industry (2010) Journal of Financial Management of Property and Construction, 152, pp. 118-142; Lesniak, A., Plebankiewicz, E., Modeling the Decision-Making Process Concerning Participation in Construction Bidding (2015) Journal of Management in Engineering, 312, p. 4014032; Biruk, S., Jaskowski, P., Czarnigowska, A., Modeling Contractor's Bidding Decisions (2017) Procedia Engineering, 182, pp. 91-98; http://www.nowowydane.pl/cen, Centrum edukacji i nauczania, [Online:], [Access: 15-Jan-2018]; Larose, D.T., Larose, C.D., (2016) Discovering Knowledge in Data, , Willey IEEE, ISBN978-81-265-5834-6; Morzy, T., (2013) Eksploracja Danych.

In this opening scenario, information and communication technologies play an important role in facilitating the delivery of information that is made available to citizens seeking to enable greater control over the actions of government and civil servants. Nevertheless, in many cases, the information provided is aimed at human reading and interpretation and it is not published in machine-processable formats, a condition that hinders automatic processing using state-of-the-art computational techniques. This article presents a new method of data collection based on Crowdsourcing that allows generating data sets of public procurement processes from the unstructured information published on the Web. The results obtained show that our method allows the generation of reliable public procurement data sets in a scalable way whose scope is limited by the availability of data and the transparency of the country. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.;;"Crowdsourcing; Transparency; Automatic processing; Civil servants; Computational technique; Data collection; Information and Communication Technologies; Public information; Public procurement; State of the art; Computer circuits";"Mundial, B., (1997) Helping Countries Combat Corruption: The Role of the World Bank, , PREM; Fan, Y., Zhang, Z., Yue, Q., E-government, Transparency and Anti-corruption (2009) Management of E-Commerce and E-Government, pp. 101-104; Welp, Y., (2007) ¿hacia El Fin de la Administración Pública Burocrática?, , Universitat Pompeu Fabra; Criado, J.I., Corojan, A., (2010) ¿pueden Las TIC Cambiar la Transparencia, Lucha Contra la Corrupción y Rendición de Cuentas en Los Gobiernos Latinoamericanos?, pp. 2037-2072. , XIV ELE; Dietrich, D., Gray, J., McNamara, T., Poikola, A., Pollock, P., Tait, J., Zijlstra, T., (2009) Open Data Handbook; Fazekas, M., Tóth, I., King, L., An objective corruption risk index using public procurement data (2016) European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research, 22 (3), pp. 369-397; Papadopoulou, C., Giaoutzi, M., Crowdsourcing as a tool for knowledge acquisition in spatial planning (2014) Future.

The mass survey of customers and suppliers carried out by the Institute for Industrial and Market Studies in 2017 showed that about a half of the customers followed a strategy of contracting predetermined suppliers in 2014-2016. Moreover, different explanations of this practice (justification, accusation or a combination of both reasons) allowed us to identify groups of suppliers that differ significantly in their models of behavior in the public procurement market. © 2018 NP “Voprosy Ekonomiki”.

In literature, there are very few studies that have sought to unravel the connectedness between the ethical and cost performances of projects. This paper aims to report findings on the relationship between unethical tendering practices and cost performance of projects in the Nigerian public sector. Design/methodology/approach: A survey of participants in 119 public projects in Nigeria was conducted. Noting the infrequent use of canonical correlation in construction studies, this study made use of the technique in identifying the significant unethical tendering practices that affect the cost performance of projects. Findings: Findings include three contractor-related variables: C1: Competitors offer bribes to gain access to confidential tendering information, C2: Competitors overstating their capacity, experience and qualification to secure construction contracts, C3: The same owner(s) use different firms to tender for the same project; and four clients/consultants-related variables: T5: Client divulging more information to preferred bidder, T9: Project requirements overstated or tailored to fit a preferred bidder, T14: Criteria for selecting winner not made public, E1: Chief executive of client organization intervenes in tender evaluation and helps his/her preferred tenderer win the contract affect the cost performance of projects. Practical implications: Chief executives of procuring entities should no longer act as the chairpersons of their organisations’ tenders boards. This role should be given to reputable members of the core construction professional bodies. Originality/value: This study links ethical performance of projects to their cost performance using the canonical correlation technique. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.";Canonical correlation, Cost performance, Public procurement, Tendering, Unethical practices;;"Abdul Rahman, I., Memon, A.H., Karim, A., Tarmizi, A., Significant factors causing cost overruns in large construction projects in Malaysia (2013) Journal of Applied Sciences, 13 (2), pp. 286-293; Adnan, H., Hashim, N., Mohd, N., Ahmad, N., Ethical issues in the construction industry: contractor’s perspective (2012) Procedia-Social and Behavioural Sciences, 35, pp. 719-727. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.02.142; Agaba, E., Shipmen, N., Public procurement reform in developing countries: the Uganda experience (2005) Challenges in Public Procurement: An International Perspective, pp. 373-391. , Thai, K.V., Araujo, A., Cartre, R.Y., Callender, G., Drabkin, D., Grimm, R., Jensen, K.R.E., Lloyd, R.E., McCue, C.P. and Telgen, J. and, PrAcademics Press, Boca Raton, FL; Alfred, O.O., Conflict of interest within construction practitioners: quantity surveying, case study (2007) Surveying and Built Environment, 18 (1), pp. 35-50; Ali, A.S., Kamaruzzaman, S.N., Cost performance for building construction projects in Klang valley (2010) Journal of Building Performance, 1 (1); Ameh, J.O., Odusami, K.T., Nigerian building professionals’ ethical ideology and perceived ethical judgement (2010) Australasian Journal of Construction Economics and Building, 10 (3), pp. 1-13; Ameh, O.J., Odusami, K.T., Professionals’ ambivalence toward ethics in the Nigerian construction industry (2010) Journal of Professional Issues in Engineering Education and Practice, 136 (1), pp. 9-16; Ameyaw, C., Mensah, S., Osei-Tutu, E., Improving transparency in public procurement in Ghana (2012) Proceedings of 1st Applied Research Conference in Africa.(ARCA) Conference, pp. 29-31; Ameyaw, C., Mensah, S., Osei-Tutu, E., Public procurement in Ghana: the implementation challenges to the public procurement law 2003 (Act 663) (2012) International Journal of Construction Supply Chain Management, 2 (2), pp. 55-65; Ameyaw, E.E., Pärn, E., Chan, A.P., Owusu-Manu, D.G., Edwards, D.J., Darko, A., Corrupt practices in the construction industry: survey of Ghanaian experience (2017) Journal of Management in Engineering, 33 (6), p. 05017006; (2004) Civil engineers call For global standards to curb trillion dollar worldwide corruption, , http://asce.org/pressroom/news/display_press.cfm?uid=1711, Press Release; Anderson, R.E., Tatham, R.L., Black, W.C., (1998) Multivariate Data Analysis, , 5th ed., Prentice Hall, London; Azhar, N., Farooqui, R.U., Ahmed, S.M., Cost overrun factors in construction industry of Pakistan (2008) Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Construction in Developing Countries: Advancing and Integrating Construction Education, Research and Practice, pp. 499-508. , NED University of Engineering and Technology Karachi, 4-5 August; Behn, R.D., Why measure performance?

To that effect, the purpose of this paper is to present the applicability of a benchmarking model as an instrument for improving accountability of procuring entities such as LGAs in public procurement practices. Design/methodology/approach: A case study from United States Agency for International Development funded Chemonics International’s Program—Pamoja Twajenga in Tanzania has been used to effectively showcase the efficacy of the benchmarking model in increasing compliance and improve accountability of LGAs as procuring entities. Performance assessment of eight Tanzania LGAs’ internal public procurement practices was conducted using the benchmarking model. Benchmarking Framework of Compliance Standards and Performance Indictors in Public Procurement (FCSPIPP) was developed and applied in conducting a benchmark assessment of the LGAs. The methodology of a benchmark assessment encompassed number scoring of perceived performance of each LGA for each indicator of a compliance standard. Findings: The case study has conceded that the benchmarking model is an instrument which can be applied for improving the accountability of LGAs in public procurement practices. Looking at the scale of LGAs’ purchases, the case study reveals that monitoring compliance may greatly benefit from the methodological approach of benchmarking. The benchmark assessment adopted in this case study offers a collective instrument for LGAs in developing countries to measure, compare and learn to improve in public procurement practices. The model offers public procurement entities, such as LGAs, with an opportunity to learn based on performance and improvement of peers. The FCSPIPP presented in this case study is the main pillar of the benchmark assessment in public procurement. Research limitations/implications: The major limitation of this case study is that it relies only on the findings and lessons learnt from the benchmarking of eight LGAs in Tanzania. Presumably, it would be useful to would have been more useful if more countries from developing economies were included in the case study; it could have increased the plausibility of the applicability of the model at the local government levels. Practical implications: Implicitly, public procurement and regulatory authorities in developing countries need to learn, improve its role and develop capacity in the application of benchmarking for enforcing compliance in public procurement practices. Since the approach is based on listening from the procuring entities, the model provides the procurement Authority to work on policy challenges affecting the procuring entities to comply with what the procurement process requires. Deliberate efforts are needed to strengthen the capacity of developing countries to put in place policies and reforms that pave the way for the use of process benchmarking in public procurement at the LGAs level. Social implications: Since benchmarking encourages active participation of the user department and community in the procurement process, presupposes curbing corruption red flags and improved value for money contracts for improved social services. The methodological approach of monitoring procuring entities, using process benchmarking, provides public procurement and regulatory agencies and LGAs a collegial, participative and self-discovering on what constitutes compliance. This may enhance the sense of answerability of procurement officers to citizens. Originality/value: This study confirms the efficacy of the benchmarking model as an alternative and complementary instrument to traditional compliance audit in public procurement. The application of an FCSPIPP means that benchmarking results may be used to improve public procurement practices. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.";Benchmarking, Compliance standards, Local government authorities, Public accountability, Public procurement;;"Abbey, E.E., (2009) Public procurement claims 80% state funds, , www.modernghana.com/news/251728/procurement-claims-80-state-funds.html, Daily GuideBusiness Finance, Public Procurement ReformDeveloping Countries: (accessed, June 17, 2016; Agaba, E., Shipman, N., (2017) Public procurement reform in developing countries: the Uganda experience, , www.ippa.org/IPPC2/BOOK/Chapter_16.pdf, (accessed, May 6, 2017; (2011) What is public accountability?, , www.ago.gov.sg/docs/default-source/publication/68b41542-49ed-4117-92d6-563f53d12b38.pdf, Auditor General Office of Singapore: (accessed, June 4, 2017; Ambe, I.M., Badenhorst-Weiss, J.A., Procurement challenges in the South African public sector (2012) Journal of Transport and Supply Chain Management, 6 (1), p. a63. , www.jtscm.co.za/index.php/jtscm/article/download/63/59, p., Department of Business Management, University of South Africa (Unisa): (accessed, May 6, 2017; Bovens, M., (2003) Public Accountability: Paper for the EGPA Annual Conference, , www.usg.uu.nl/organisatie/medewerkers/m.bovens, Oeiras: September 3-6, presentedworkshop 8 (Ethics and integrity of Governance) Utrecht School of Governance, Utrecht University: (accessed, May 27, 2017; Cho, G., (2013) Tanzania continues to struggle with corruption in public procurement, , www.procurementbulletin.com/tanzania-continues-to-struggle-with-corruption-in-public-procurement/, Procurement Bulletin: (accessed, June 18, 2016; (2017) Public procurement, , www.epa.ie/about/procurement/, (accessed, April 26, 2017; Gachio, D., (2014) Public procurement in Kenya, , https://tikenya.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/adili-145, Cash Cow for the Corrupt or Enabler for Public Service Delivery?

Our focus is on Montreal's asphalt industry, where there have been allegations of bid rigging, market segmentation, complementary bidding, and bribes to bureaucrats, and where, in 2009, a police investigation was launched. We collect procurement data and use a difference-in-difference approach to compare outcomes before and after the investigation in Montreal and in Quebec City, where there have been no allegations of collusion or corruption. We find that entry and participation increased, and that the price of procurement decreased. We then decompose the price decrease to quantify the importance of two aspects of cartel organization, coordination and entry deterrence, for collusive pricing. We find that the latter explains only a small part of the decrease. © The Author(s) 2018.;;;"Arozamena, L., Weinschelbaum, F., The Effect of Corruption on Bidding Behavior in First-Price Auctions (2009) European Economic Review, 53, pp. 645-657; Asker, J., A Study of the Internal Organization of a Bidding Cartel (2010) American Economic Review, 100 (3), pp. 724-762; Athey, S., Levin, J., Seira, E., Comparing Open and Sealed Bid Auctions: Evidence from Timber Auctions (2011) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 126, pp. 207-257; Bajari, P., Hong, H., Ryan, S., Identification and Estimation of Discrete Games of Complete Information (2010) Econometrica, 78, pp. 1529-1568; Bajari, P., Houghton, S., Tadelis, S., Bidding for Incomplete Contracts: An Empirical Analysis of Adaptation Costs (2014) American Economic Review, 104, pp. 1288-1319; Bajari, P., Ye, L., Deciding between Competition and Collusion (2003) Review of Economics and Statistics, 85 (4), pp. 971-989; Bandiera, O., Prat, A., Valletti, T., Active and Passive Waste in Government Spending: Evidence from a Policy Experiment (2009) American Economic Review, 99, pp. 1278-1308; Charbonneau, F., Lachance, R., (2015) Rapport Final de la Commission d'Enquete sur l'Octroi et la Gestion des Contrats Publics dans l'Industrie de la Construction, , Technical report, Commission d'enquete sur l'octroi et la gestion des contrats publics dans l'industrie de la construction; Chassang, S., Ortner, J., (2015) Collusion in Auctions with Constrained Bids: Theory and Evidence from Public Procurement; Clark, R., Houde, J.-F., Collusion with Asymmetric Retailers: Evidence from a Gasoline Price Fixing Case (2013) American Economic Journal: Microeconomics, 5 (3), pp. 97-123; Clark, R., Houde, J.-F., The Effect of Explicit Communication on Pricing: Evidence from the Collapse of a Gasoline Cartel (2014) Journal of Industrial Economics, 62, pp. 191-228; Coate, M.B., Techniques for Protecting against Collusion in Sealed Bid Markets (1985) Antitrust Bulletin, 30, pp. 897-914; Conley, T., Decarolis, F., Detecting Bidders Groups in Collusive Auctions (2016) American Economic Journal: Microeconomics, 8, pp. 1-38; Coviello, D., Gagliarducci, S., Tenure in Office and Public Procurement (2017) American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, 3, pp. 59-105; Coviello, D., Mariniello, M., Publicity Requirements in Public Procurement (2014) Journal of Public Economics, 109, pp. 76-100; Di Iorio, P., (2012) Testimony from the Commission d'Enquête sur l'Octroi et la Gestion des Contrats Publics dans l'Industrie de la Construction; Dimitri, N., Piga, G., Spagnolo, G., Introduction (2006) Handbook of Procurement, , in N.

Some 1.5 million public contracts from across Europe are analyzed through statistical models that compare contracting patterns between good- and poor-governance regions. At the most basic level, the results can be interpreted as a rejection of a conventional view of the relation between governance and institutional choices and outcomes. It is not the case that poorly governed jurisdictions allow more discretion to public officials, that they impose more limits on access to markets, or that they clearly feature more competition, and in fact the opposite often holds. Going beyond this negative finding, the article argues that an alternative view of institutional choice and its connection with governance, in which some discretion and flexibility is desirable, can provide a better explanation of observed patterns, and can have important implications for institutional design. © European Consortium for Political Research 2017.;corruption, governance, institutions, policy, public contracts;;"Acemoglu, D., Robinson, J., (2012) Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, , Prosperity, and Poverty, New York: Crown Publishers; Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., Robinson, A., The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation (2001) The American Economic Review, 91 (5), pp. 1369-1401; Ainsley, C., (2017) Central Bank Transparency and the Performance of Market Expectations, , Unpublished Manuscript.

By comparing two municipalities with ‘clean’ and ‘rotten’ corruption records, this article shows that relatively independent bureaucrats—so-called trustees—can act as a check to prevent political moral hazard. Yet, in order to transform their de jure supervisory powers into de facto powers, the trustees must be supported by merit-based human resources policy, rules and standard operating procedures, transparency and independent watchdogs. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;local government, mayors, PP, Public procurement, Púnica case, trustee theory;Nica;"Acemoglu, D., Robinson, J., (2012) Why Nations Fail: Origins of Power, Poverty and Prosperity, , Crown Business, New York; Andersson, S., Studying the risk of corruption in the least corrupt countries (2008) Public Integrity, 10 (3), pp. 193-214. , ‘, ’; Artés, J., Jiménez, J., (2015), https://goo.gl/U9tG8k, L. & Perdiguero, J.

It is hardly a surprise that all across Europe, but especially in high corruption risk countries, it is a primary target of corrupt elites. This article provides a state-of-the-art review of the literature on the cost of corruption and estimates the level of corruption risks and associated costs in European infrastructure development and maintenance in 2009–2014 using novel data on over 40,000 government contracts. Two forms of corruption costs are investigated in the empirical section: (1) distorting spending structure and project design, and (2) inflating prices. Findings indicate that corruption steers infrastructure spending towards high value as opposed to small value investment projects. It also inflates prices by 30–35% on average with largest excesses in high corruption risk regions. Contrary to perceptions, corruption risks in infrastructure are decoupled to a considerable extent from the national corruption environment.

Public procurement however extends beyond transactions to acquire commodities to ""the relationship between the state and its suppliers, and between the state and the commodity transaction"". Global political hierarchies, with affluent democracies at the apex, play a dominant role in how states like Lesotho, with little political agency internationally buy and sell commodities and what terms and conditions attach to such transactions. This paper argues that the architecture of public procurement policy in Africa generally and Lesotho specifically is anchored in neoliberalism which emerged as the dominant economic theory globally after the end of World War II. Corruption which is critical in public procurement because of the huge quantities of commodities often being transacted and the volume of money involved in the procurement process. This creates substantial opportunities for public officials with the propensity to be corrupt because of the high profitability attached to these large procurements. According to the director of the Directorate on Corruption and Economic Offences (DCEO), public procurement in Lesotho is the most vulnerable area to corruption and public procurement cases form 99% of corruption cases handled by the DCEO in 2016. The paper argues that he most combative and dictatorial mechanism of the neoliberal approach to anti-corruption and public procurement policies in Lesotho is the lack of consideration for local contexts, particularly when such policies are adopted litereratim. The slow erosion of corruption, particularly in public procurement in Lesotho is testimony to the futility of neoliberal policies in the country. Officials often adopt neoliberal policies disingenuously and masquerade them as actual reform. Alternatively, policies are adopted to comply with foreign aid requisites or to guarantee Lesotho's place in global trade. At close inspection, the public procurement legal regime reveals weaknesses which are antithetical to the enthusiastic anti-corruption narratives that the Lesotho government performs to appease donors. Political agents in Lesotho often condemn corruption and reiterate a commitment to corruption-free procurement processes, however, overt corruption that permeates all sectors in the country contradicts this narrative. This paper provides an appraisal of the Public Procurement Regulations of Lesotho as anchored in the neoliberal approach. It argues that the socio-political nuances in Lesotho are in fundamental conflict with the neoliberal theory, making legal enforcement of the regulations extremely difficult. © 2018 Law and Development Review 2018.";corruption, neoliberalism, public procurement;;"Appolloni, J., Mushagalusa, M., Public procurement and corruption in Africa: A literature review (2013) April/June, Rivista di Politica Economica; Arrowsmith, S., Linarelli, J., Wallace, D., (2000) Regulating Public Procurement: National and International Perspectives, , London: Kluwer Law International; Bajo, A., Public financial management, accountability & citizens trust (2017) Croatian and Comparative Public Administration, 17 (3). , http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/898926.bajo.pdf, accessed 21 October; Baum, G., Beyond the market: The growth of the informal economy (1997) Outside the Market: No Salvation?, , D.

Average bid auction is widely used in public procurement for it can deal with the problem of winner's curse in the first price auction. However, it has also been accused of incentivizing bidders to collude or manipulate the average price to a high level leading to a high winning price. This kind of collusion could bring huge loss for the buyer. To address this concern, this paper proposes a method containing three steps to detect the potential collusion circle in average bid auction based on network cluster and randomization inference. Moreover, we also suggest an ex-post method and one ex-ante method for the buyers to prohibit the losses from potential collusion. © 2017 IEEE.;average bid auction, bidding behavior, collusion detection;"Fuzzy systems; Auction mechanisms; Bid auction; Bidding behavior; Collusion detection; First price auction; Network cluster; Public procurement; Winner's curse; Costs";"Kagel, J.H., Levin, D., (2009) Common Value Auctions and the Winner's Curse, , Princeton University Press; Crawford, V.P., Iriberri, N., Level-k auctions:Can anonequilibrium model of strategic thinking explain the winner's curse and overbidding in private-value auctions (2007) Econometrica, 75 (6), pp. 1721-1770; Chang, W.S., Chen, B., Salmon, T.C., An investigation of the average bid mechanism for procurement auctions (2014) Manage.

The increase in anti-corruption measures globally reflects a consensus that corruption is pervasive and costly. Public procurement is one area in which corruption manifests because of the sums of money involved; the asymmetry of information; and the bureaucratic nature of decision-making, which presents opportunities for abuse. In developing countries, procurement corruption is rife because of institutional weaknesses, lack of enforced accountability mechanisms and culture of silence in relation to public sector malfeasance. Design/methodology/approach: This paper examines procurement corruption in countries with systemic corruption, using Nigeria as a case study, to determine how to reduce public procurement corruption. Findings: The paper will highlight prevalent corrupt schemes in public procurement in Nigeria, examine the reasons for the failure of state anti-corruption institutions and analyze the kinds of initiatives that reduced procurement corruption and increased accountability in other countries and the utility of adopting such mechanisms in the Nigerian context. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.";Developing countries, Public procurement, Systemic corruption;;"Achua, J.K., Anti-corruption in public procurement in Nigeria: challenges and competency strategies (2011) Journal of Public Procurement, 11 (3), p. 323; Adeyemo, F., Whistle blowing: the position of Nigerian legislation in banking (2015) Journal of Law, Policy and Globalization, 41, pp. 143-146; Aguilar, M.A., Gill, J.B.S., Pino, L., (2000) Preventing Fraud and Corruption in World Bank Contracts: A Guide for Staff, , World Bank, Washington, DC; Albano, G.L., Buccirossi, P., Spagnolo, G., Zanza, M., Preventing collusion in public procurement (2006) Handbook of Procurement, pp. 347-380. , Dimitri N., Paga G. and Spagnolo G., and (Eds), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Anechiarico, F., Jacobs, J.B., (1996) The Pursuit of Absolute Integrity: How Corruption Control Makes Government Ineffective, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Apampa, S., The case of corruption in Nigeria (2005) The New Institutional Economics of Corruption, pp. 236-252. , Lambsdorff, J.G.M. and Taube, M.

[1] in the present work we propose an economic model regarding the relationship between corruption in public procurement and economic growth. We extend the benchmark model by introducing endogenous labor force growth, described by the logistic equation. The results of previous studies, as Del Monte and Papagni [2] and Mauro [3], show that countries are stuck in one of the two equilibria (high corruption and low economic growth or low corruption and high economic growth). Brianzoni et al. [1] prove the existence of a further steady state characterized by intermediate levels of capital per capita and corruption. Our aim is to investigate the effects of the endogenous growth around such equilibrium. Moreover, due to the high number of parameters of the model, specific attention is given to the numerical simulations which highlight new policy measures that can be adopted by the government to fight corruption. © 2017;Corruption, Discrete dynamics, Economic growth, Endogenous labor force growth;"Crime; Corruption; Discrete dynamics; Economic growths; Endogenous growth; Intermediate level; Labor force; Logistic equations; Public procurement; Economics";"Brianzoni, S., Coppier, R., Michetti, E., Multiple equilibria in a discrete time growth model with corruption in public procurement (2015) Qual Quant, pp. 1-24; Del Monte, A., Papagni, E., Public expenditure, corruption, and economic growth: the case of Italy (2001) Eur J Polit Econ, 17 (1), pp. 1-16; Mauro, P., Corruption and growth (1995) Q J Econ, 110, pp. 681-712; Tramontana, F., Sushko, I., Avrutin, V., Period adding structure in a 2D discontinuous model of economic growth (2015) Appl Math Comput, 253, pp. 262-273; Böhm, V., Kaas, L., Differential savings, factor shares, and endogenous growth cycles (2000) J Econ Dyn Control, 24 (5), pp. 965-980; Tramontana, F., Avrutin, V., Complex endogenous dynamics in a one-sector growth model with differential savings (2014) Technical report, , University of Pavia, Department of Economics and Management; Benhabib, J., Spiegel, M.M., The role of human capital in economic development evidence from aggregate cross-country data (1994) J Monet Econ, 34 (2), pp. 143-173; Boldrin, M., Montrucchio, L., On the indeterminacy of capital accumulation paths (1986) J Econ Theory, 40 (1), pp. 26-39; Day, R.H., Irregular growth cycles (1982) Am Econ Rev, 72, pp. 406-414; Brianzoni, S., Mammana, C., Michetti, E., Nonlinear dynamics in a business-cycle model with logistic population growth (2009) Chaos Solitons Fractals, 40 (2), pp. 717-730; Brianzoni, S., Mammana, C., Michetti, E., Local and global dynamics in a discrete time growth model with nonconcave production function (2012) Discrete Dyn Nat Soc, 2012. , 22 pages; Cheban, D., Mammana, C., Michetti, E., Non-autonomous difference equations: global attractor in a business-cycle model with endogenous population growth (2015) Dyn Syst Appl, 24, pp. 17-33; Matsumoto, A., Let it be: chaotic price instability can be beneficial (2003) Chaos Solitons Fractals, 18 (4), pp. 745-758; Kühn, S., Sherman, L.B., (2014), Http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/curbing_corruption_in_public_procurement_a_practical_guide, Transparency International.

However, in Russia public procurement has had no significant impact on developing innovation. Empirical research with expert interviews and qualitative and quantitative data analysis has revealed the reasons for poor performance to promote innovation, including tough anti-trust and anti-corruption rules, limited use of tenders as well as “life-cycle cost” criteria, and poor management by the procuring agencies. The analysis revealed the contradiction between the rules designed for fighting corruption and monopolies and the need to stimulate innovation through procurement. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;Demand for innovation, policy of innovation, public procurement, Russia, tender;;"Abdrahimov, D., Slozhnye konkursnye zakupki produkcii dlja gosnuzhd: Problemy i osobennosti provedenija (1999) Konkursnye Torgi, 11, pp. 12-15; Belev, S., Boldareva, O., Zolotareva, A., Sokolov, I., (2012) Osobennosti sistemy gosudarstvennyh zakupok innovacionnoj produkcii v Rossii i mire, , Izdatel’skij dom “Delo”.

Customers, who procure for themselves, and Agencies, who procure for the customers in their region are considered. Basing on a large dataset of open auctions conducted by Russian regional-level authorities in 2011, the analysis shows that in highly corrupt regions, Agencies fail to arrange competitive tenders and most of auctions have one bidder. Customers attract more bidders for large contracts, but rebates are usually low. Therefore, procurement centralization may reduce the corruption of Customers, but cannot solve the problem of low competition. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.;centralization, competition, corruption, procurement procedure, Public procurement, repeated contract;;"Ades, A., Di Tella, R., Rents, competition, and corruption (1999) American Economic Review, 89 (4), pp. 982-993; Aidt, T.S., Economic analysis of corruption: A survey (2003) The Economic Journal, 113, p. 491; Albano, G.L., Sparro, M., Flexible strategies for centralized public procurement (2010) Review of Economics and Institutions, pp. 1-32. , 1, (2); Alexeev, M., Song, Y., Corruption and product market competition: An empirical investigation (2013) Journal of Development Economics, 103, pp. 154-166; Arikan, G.G., Fiscal decentralization: A remedy for corruption?

While the growing literature on Turkey’s media system has explored the influence of political and economic pressures on media freedoms, recent developments necessitate a re-examination that tackles the upsurge of direct government intervention in the country’s commercial media landscape. Through the framework of media capture, this article analyses the disciplinary strategies deployed by AKP and argues that the party’s media capture at recent political junctures (Gezi protests, corruption scandal, coup attempt) is continuous with its past policies and practices and does not necessarily represent an ‘authoritarian turn’. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;AKP, authoritarianism, media capture, media ownership, neoliberalism, privatisation, public procurement, Turkey;"authoritarianism; finance; governance approach; legal system; media role; neoliberalism; organizational framework; ownership; popular protest; privatization; Turkey";"Adakli, G., (2006) Turkiye’de Medya Endustrisi: Neoliberalizm Caginda Mulkiyet ve Kontrol Iliskileri [Media Industry in Turkey: Ownership and Control Relations in the Era of Neoliberalism], , Utopya, Ankara, Turkey; Adaklı, G., The process of neoliberalisation and the transformation of the Turkish media sector in the context of the new media architecture (2009) Mediating Europe: Communication in Contemporary European Culture Contents, pp. 286-317. , Harrison J., Wessel B., (eds), Berghahn, Oxford:) ‘, ’, eds; Akça, İ., Hegemonic projects in post-1980 Turkey and the changing forms of authoritarianism (2013) Turkey Reframed: Constituting Neoliberal Hegemony, pp. 13-46. , Özden B.A., Akça İ., Bekmen A., (eds), Pluto, London:) ‘, ’, eds; Akser, M., Baybars-Hawks, B., Media and democracy in Turkey: toward a model of neoliberal media autocracy (2012) Middle East Journal of Culture and Communication, 5 (3), pp. 302-321. , ‘, ’; Altheide, D., Coyle, M., DeVriese, K., Schneider, C., Emergent qualitative document analysis (2008) Handbook of Emergent Methods, pp. 127-151. , Hesse-Biber S.N., Leavy P., (eds), Guildford Press, New York: &,) ‘, ’, eds; Bagdikian, B., (2004) The Media Monopoly, , Beacon Press, Boston, MA; Besley, T., Pratt, A., Handcuffs for the grabbing hand?

Using data from a major rural road construction programme in India we document political influence in a setting where politicians have no official role in contracting decisions. Exploiting close elections to identify the causal effect of coming to power, we show that the share of contractors whose name matches that of the winning politician increases by 83% (from 4% to 7%) in the term after a close election compared to the term before. Regression discontinuity estimates at the road level show that political interference raises the cost of road construction and increases the likelihood that roads go missing. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;Corruption, Kinship networks, Political connections, Public procurement;"corruption; election; kinship; political power; road construction; rural politics; India";"Acemoglu, D., Hassan, T., Tahoun, A., The Power of the Streets: Evidence from Egypt's Arab Spring (2014), Mimeo MIT; Aggarwal, S., Do rural roads create pathways out of poverty?

It describes the contemporary face of corruption by investigating the role of public accountability in the fight against corruption. The paper describes a specific episode of corruption relative to the awarding of government contracts for big events, such as the celebration of the 150th anniversary of Italian unification. Relying on the philosophical insights of Rousseau, Popper, Kant and others, the study suggests the need for enabling a democratic control and constructing a public ethics for the common good. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd;Accountability, Corruption, New public governance, New public management, Public procurement, Social contract;;"Agere, S., (2000) Promoting good governance: Principles, practices and perspectives, 11. , Commonwealth Secretariat; Agranoff, R., Intergovernmental and network administration, accountability, and performance: Symposium introduction (2008) Public Perform.

This study conducted to do investigation of success rate of implementation of e-procurement in terms of some of the factors of good governance in the Indonesian government. Questionnaires were distributed to supplier who provide goods and/or services listed in the system. Data was analyzed by Structural Equation Model using Partial Least Square method.

The methodological basis of the study was the legislative acts, statutory documents on the theme of work, fundamental theoretical works, results of practical studies of prominent domestic and foreign scientists. According to the results, it is important to note that the closed competitive tender is characterized by the fact that the offer to participate in it, is drawn to a certain circle of persons at the discretion of the competition’s organizer. The authors of the study came to the main conclusion that the law on state procurement is being improved, the Law ""On State Procurement"" is being updated, and orders are issued on topical issues, namely on combating corruption. © 2018 International Strategic Management Association.

Being a financial lawyer, I was intrigued to find out more about the ancient rules of using up public funds and what corruptive and cultural influences shaped these procedures. I was also interested in finding similarities between past and present public procurement practices. In my work, bedsides the original sources, I used the monographs and summative studies of contemporary authors as well as my own expertise acquired as a public procurement consultant. © 2018, STS Science Centre Ltd.

Domínguez-Herrera M.M., González-Morales O., González-Díaz E.;"57202450444;57190960997;57224117533;";Corporate social responsibility of the construction sector in Spain;2018;Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): Practices, Issues and Global Perspectives;;;;215;268;;;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048409776&partnerID=40&md5=fba59eddf1b229a2091402ecc86392f7;Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a transformation of corporate culture ranging from the pursuit of value and maximum economic benefit to the commitment to contributing to sustainable development, collaborating with different social agents, governments, international organizations, global civil society and social movements. CSR is a more effective alternative to minimize the negative impacts of a company’s activity and generates a shared value between the company and society. The rise in world population, increasing urbanization and volume of construction has accelerated over the last 50 years. This situation leads to the need to systematize the use of limited resources. Increased demand for natural resources threatens the global economic and social balance and the construction sector is an important sector contributing to the depletion of energy and resources, it is therefore imperative to change the strategy and decision-taking in this sector. Construction has an important effect on other sectors and its socially responsible performance should be holistic. But these companies encounter obstacles, often related to the internal workings of the company such as its attitude of the top management, no clear lines of responsibility, financial constraints and external causes like the absence of initiatives and government incentives. Nowadays, lines of public action are aimed at promoting CSR from different European public policies. In this respect, the public administrations themselves should set a good example in public procurement processes, setting standards e.g., to reduce energy consumption or promote the use of renewable sources and to enforce existing regulations and combat corruption. Based on these premises, the objective of this work is to reflect on the importance of CSR in the objectives and strategies of companies in the construction sector. There is a summary of the lines of action on CSR recommended by the European Union, based on the definition of CSR set out by the European Commission. This definition has two dimensions, one internal such as human resources management, occupational health and safety, adaptation to change and management of environmental impact and natural resources and an external dimension including the development of local communities, collaboration with business partners, suppliers and consumers, and linked to human rights with the adoption of codes of conduct, thereby helping to solve some global ecological problems. Changes in the conception of sustainability, evaluation systems and the use of sustainability indexes are analyzed here and there is also an explanation of the evaluation of the life cycle of materials and products used in the construction industry. All this is framed in the context of Spain as the construction sector plays an important role within the business structure of Spain and is closely related to other sectors, especially the tourism sector that demands various kinds of services. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.;Construction sector, Corporate social responsibility, Spain, Sustainability;;"Aguado, A., Gálvez, J., Introducción a la Sostenibilidad en el Sector de la Construcción.

One very successful developer of an e-procurement system is the Public Procurement Policy Institution, or Lembaga Kebijakan Pengadaan Barang/Jasa Pemerintah (LKPP), with 731 government agencies and 333,452 suppliers accessing LKPP's system. This study was conducted to analyse the determinants of an e-procurement system's success as well as its impact on perceived transparency from the supplier's perspective. This study answers both questions by applying a covariance-based structural equation modelling approach to analyse the survey data of 157 respondents. This study finds that only system quality, service quality, regulation, trust, user satisfaction, and perceived benefits determine an e-procurement system's success.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a Portfolio Choice Framework, the study employs two different estimation techniques as Generalized Method of Moment and Fixed Effect Regression on panel data sets of 32 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa over the period 2000-2012. Findings: The variable of interest, corruption, retains its expected positive sign and statistically significant across all the estimations. The relationship remains very strong even when other equally important institutional variables such as regime durability, rule of law and independence of the executive are taken into account. This suggests that a higher perception of corruption among public authorities as in bribery, kickbacks in public procurement, embezzlement of public funds, among others facilitates an increase in capital outflow from SSA. The findings further indicate that regime durability and rule of law are important institutional variables that also significantly influence capital flights in SSA. Practical implications: The findings imply that institutional reforms should be encouraged if SSA is to win the war against corruption and by extension against capital flight. There should be a creation of democratic environment and good governance practices that foster stronger governance institutions, decline in corruption and better domestic investment climate to help reverse the high spate of capital flight in the region. Originality/value: The main value of this paper is using the portfolio choice framework to analyze the relationship between capital flight and corruption in the Sub-Saharan African context. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Capital flight, Corruption, Governance, Institutions, Sub-Saharan Africa;;"Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., Robinson, J.A., The colonial origins of comparative development: an empirical investigation (2001) American Economic Review, 91 (5), pp. 1369-1401; Ajayi, S.I., An analysis of external debt and capital flight in the severely indebted low-income countries (1997) External Finance for Low-Income Countries, , Iqbal, Z. and Kanbur, R (Eds), International Monetary Fund, Washington, DC; Ajayi, S.I., Ndikumana, L., (2015) Capital Flight from Africa: Causes, Effects and Policy Issues, , (Eds) (, Oxford University Press, Oxford; Ali, A., Bernard, W., (2011) On the causes of capital flight from Sub-Saharan Africa, , www.csae.ox.ac.uk/conferences/2011-EdiA/papers/679-Ali.pdf, Center for the Study of African Economies, Conference Papers, University of Oxford; Boyce, J.K., The revolving door?

In most countries, audit authorities are responsible for monitoring costs but do not distinguish both sources of inefficiency in their audits. Judicial courts typically rely on these cost audits, but only sanction corruption. In a model of public procurement by politicians, we study how the respective quality of the two courts affects corruption as well as cost efficiency. We find that while better courts have the direct effect of decreasing corruption, they may have a negative indirect effect on the abilities of the pool of politicians, so that the net effect on cost efficiency is ambiguous. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;Adverse selection, Moral hazard, Procurement;;"Antonakis, J., Dalgas, O., Predicting elections: child's play!

However, P3s, due to their unique characteristics, can present opportunities for corruption. The purpose of this article is to promote the development of a nuanced and thorough understanding of P3 corruption risks such that those involved in developing, designing, and implementing P3s can more effectively harness the benefits of P3s while mitigating the corruption risks they introduce. This article also seeks to encourage further research into how infrastructure P3s can be better shaped to decrease the probability of corruption risks materializing. This article unpacks how and why P3s, as a distinct form of public procurement, are at once more and less susceptible to corruption as compared with traditional procurement methods and as such deserve special attention from an anticorruption perspective. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.;legislation, policy, project management, public works public–private partnerships, regulatory issues, roles;;"(2005) Synthesis of public-private partnership projects for roads, bridges & tunnels from around the world, 1985-2004, , Washington, DC, United States Department of Transportation; Boase, J.P., Beyond government?

In public procurement markets, however, bid-rigging schemes are often accompanied by corruption of public officials. In the absence of coordinated forms of leniency (or rewards) for unveiling corruption, a policy offering immunity from antitrust sanctions may not be sufficient to encourage wrongdoers to blow the whistle, as the leniency recipient will then be exposed to the risk of conviction for corruption. This article assesses the extent of this problem by describing and discussing the antitrust and anti-corruption provisions present in a few selected countries, under both common law and civil law regimes. For each of these countries, we try to evaluate whether the legal system presents any solution to limiting the risk that legal provisions against corruption undermine the effectiveness of leniency programs against bid rigging in public procurement. Legal harmonization, coordination, and co-operation on procedural and substantive issues, and inter- and intra-jurisdictions, seem essential to solve this problem. Given the size of public procurement markets and their propensity for cartelization, specific improvements in legislation appear necessary in all the countries considered. Explicitly introducing leniency policies for corruption, as has been done recently in Brazil and Mexico and is being experimented in the United States, is only a first step. The antitrust experience has taught us that to achieve their goals of inducing whistleblowing, these policies must be carefully designed and sufficiently generous with (only) the first reporting party, they should not be discretional, they must be backed by robust sanctions, and they must be consistently implemented. Hence, the road ahead appears a long one. To increase the effectiveness of leniency in multiple offense cases, we suggest, besides extending automatic leniency to individual criminal sanctions, the creation of a ""one-stop point"" enabling firms and individuals to report different crimes simultaneously and receive leniency for all of them at once if they are entitled to it. As long as individual criminal charges are not covered by a coordinated and nondiscretional leniency program, there is little hope that these provisions will induce any improvement in the fight against corrupting cartels. A more effective way to fight such cartels may then be offering Qui Tam rewards to nonaccomplice whistleblowers, as is already done with apparent success by several law enforcement agencies in the United States. © The Author(s) 2017.";;;"Harrington, J.E., Chang, M.-H., When Can We Expect a Corporate Leniency Program to Result in Fewer Cartels? ssrn.com/abstract=2530545, 2 (August 11, 2014), date last accessed 6 November 2016; Buccirossi, P., (2015) Leniency and Damages, , ssrn.com/abstract=2566774, November 29; Leslie, C.R., Antitrust Amnesty, Game Theory, and Cartel Stability (2006) J.

In this exploratory study, we investigate cross-country learning across two frequently used policy areas: sustainability and innovation. A threefold methodology was used that consisted of (1) an extensive review of scientific literature complemented by (2) a thorough examination of policy documents and (3) interviews with leading public procurement experts from 10 countries including both developing and developed countries. The main findings indicate that there is no hard evidence for cross-country learning. Even if cross-country learning would exist, the lessons learned seem to remain largely implicit. © 2017 by PrAcademics Press.;;;"Adler, E., Clark, R., (2015) An Invitation to Social Research: How It's Done, , 5th ed.).

A selection of attributes with fraud suspicion signs is performed. It is necessary to accomplish, first of all, because fraud in the public procurement sphere is one of the most common kinds of frauds. With a view to improve the existing anti-corruption enforcement system, we offer a new approach to the analysis of data and detection of potential threats in the sphere of public procurements based on cluster analysis and data mining techniques. © 2017 IEEE.;Anti-corruption en-forcement, Bad-faith supplier, Cluster analysis, Data mining, Law violations, Public procurements, Spending of budgetary funds;"Budget control; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Internet of things; Social networking (online); Vector spaces; Anti-corruption; Bad faith; Law violation; Public procurement; Spending of budgetary funds; Crime";"Office of the Inspector General Investigations [Electronic Resource]: Procurement Fraud Indicators 2013, , https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/fraud_awareness_handbook_052201.PDF, visited on 27.04.2017; Transparency International: Corruption Perception Index- 2016 [Electronic Resource], , http://www.transparency.org, visited on 27.04.2017; The SAS Fraud Framework for Government [Electronic Resource]: Official Website, , https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/en_us/doc/overviewbrochure/sas-fraud-framework-government-104497.pdf, visited on: 25.04.2017; Barson, P., (1996) The Detection of Fraud in Mobile Phone Networks, Neural Network World, 6 (4), pp. 42-54. , P.

However, we lack robust systematic evidence on whether deregulation actually lowers corruption. This is partially due to the difficulty of defining what is good regulation, but also to the lack of theoretical clarity about which type of corruption regulations impact on and to the deficient measurement of different types of corruption. In order to address the latter two gaps, we differentiate petty corruption from government favouritism and propose novel measurement of the latter by developing two objective proxy measures of favouritism in public procurement: single bidding in competitive markets and a composite score of tendering ‘red flags’. Using publicly available official electronic records of over 2.5 million government contracts in 27 EU member states and two European Economic Area countries in 2009–2014, we directly operationalize a common definition of favouritism: unjustified restriction of access to public contracts to favour a certain bidder. Petty corruption is measured using business surveys while the extent of business regulation is measured by Doing Business expert assessment of precise regulatory costs. Using country-level panel regression analysis, we find that deregulation has a heterogeneous impact on both low and high level corruption. It is largely ineffective in tackling government favouritism, with business start-up deregulation even facilitating such corruption. Whereas deregulating the various channels through which governments and businesses interact (e.g. obtaining construction permits) often decreases the perception of bribery and petty corruption. Policy consequences are profound and point at a more targeted and context-dependent promotion of the deregulation agenda.

From a theoretical and methodological perspective, it will be studied how institutional analysis can facilitate the identification and understanding of the relevant factors for the good design and administration of public procurement systems. The development of a regulatory system is modulated by its institutional matrix, which structures relations between public and private actors. Some institutional variables of this regulatory system (its decisionmaking system, its control mechanisms, the required transparency, the organizational resources, and the technical capacity of government action) have a direct impact on the management of contracting systems. The article analyzes these organizational and institutional variables and their impact on public procurement systems. First, the institutional and organizational factors which may potentially undermine the efficiency and effectiveness of public procurement systems are determined. Second, the document presents a methodological model, quantitative and qualitative, to support this type of analysis.

It argues that some development partner policies could limit the policy space available to implement prioritized development goals domestically. © SOAS, University of London, 2017.;Africa, Anti-corruption, Development aid, Development partners, Development policy, Donors, Foreign aid, Ghana, Public procurement, World bank;;"Bräutigam, D.A., Knack, S., Foreign aid, institutions, and governance in Sub-Saharan Africa (2004) Economic Development and Cultural Change, 52, pp. 255-257; (2017), http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=6043, See: last accessed 10 July; Odhiambo, W., Kamau, P., Public procurement: Lessons from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda (2003) OECD Working Paper No 208, p. 10; Basheka, B., Public procurement reforms in Africa: A tool for effective governance of the public sector and poverty reduction (2009) International Handbook of Public Procurement, p. 132. , in KV Thai (ed), (Taylor & Francis); Arrowsmith, S., Quinot, G., (2013) Public Procurement Regulation in Africa, , Cambridge University Press Country studies; Arrowsmith, S., Nicholas, C., The UNCITRAL model law on procurement of goods, construction, and services (2010) Reform of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Public Procurement Regulation for the 21st Century, p. 1. , in S Arrowsmith and J Tillipman (eds), (West); Williams-Elegbe, S., The world bank's influence on procurement reform in Africa (2013) African Journal of International and Comparative Law, 21 (1), p. 95; Hayes, L., (2008) Old Habits Die Hard: Aid and Accountability in Sierra Leone, p. 22. , Eurodad; Arrowsmith, S., National and international perspectives on the regulation of public procurement: Harmony or conflict (1998) Public Procurement: Global Revolution, p. 3. , S Arrowsmith and A Davies (eds), (Kluwer Law International); Borson, F., Eu procurement policy under development aid financing (2016) European Procurement & Public Private Partnership Law Review, 11 (3), p. 220; Trepte, P., (2007) Public Procurement in the EU: A Practitioner's Guide, , Oxford University Press; Nwogwugwu, E., Towards the harmonisation of international procurement policies and practices (2005) Public Procurement Law Review, 3, p. 131; Arrowsmith, S., Wallace, D., (2000) Regulating Public Procurement: National and International Perspectives, p. 18. , Kluwer Law International; Caborn, E., Arrowsmith, S., Procurement methods in the public procurement systems of Africa Public Procurement Regulation, p. 261. , in Arrowsmith and Quinot (eds); Quinot, G., A Comparative Perspective on Supplier Remedies in African Public Procurement Systems, p. 308; De Mariz, C.L., Ménard, C., Abeillé, B., (2014) Public Procurement Reforms in Africa: Challenges in Institutions and Governance, , Oxford University Press; Williams-Elegbe, S., Beyond uncitral: The challenges of procurement reform implementation in Africa (2014) Stellenbosch Law Review, 1, p. 1; Doig, A., Watt, D., Williams, R., Why do developing country anti-corruption commissions fail to deal with corruption?

Where the technology is one that emerges from the domain of the Internet, inclusivity becomes even more acute in order to avoid widening the already existing gap in reaping the “digital dividend.” With blockchain, the obligation could even be seen as a moral one, as blockchain is said to have the potential to negate the scope for the abuse of trust by states and institutions. This could be a game changer in areas such as public procurement and the conduct of elections where abuse can lead to the denial of essential resources and a concomitant loss of life, or to conflict and mass killings. Blockchain presents an opportunity for the Internet development community to claim a degree of recognition in the human rights realm by aiding civil intervention in areas where military intervention has been deemed inappropriate. © 2017 Metaphilosophy LLC and John Wiley & Sons Ltd;anti-corruption, blockchain, cyber access, digital divide, electoral processes, human rights, inclusion, moral responsibility;;"Atzori, M., (2015) Blockchain Technology and Decentralized Governance Is the State Still Necessary?, , https://ssrn.com/abstract=2709713, (December 1).

However, restricted auctions are frequently used among EU member states to procure small contracts. In this article, we investigate this paradox. Using an original data set of 180 contracts used by a local public buyer of social housing between 2006 and 2009, we show that limiting competition may enable economies to be made on transaction costs while the most efficient bidders still come forward, and that abuses such as corruption or favouritism do not result. To our knowledge, this article is the first to shed light on the advantages of using restricted auctions when tendering small simple contracts. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Auctions, competition, public procurement;"auction; competition (economics); European Union; social housing; Europe";"Amaral, M., Saussier, S., Yvrande-Billon, A., Auction Procedures and Competition in Public Services: The Case of Urban Public Transport in France and London (2009) Utilities Policy, 17 (2), pp. 166-175; Amaral, M., Saussier, S., Yvrande-Billon, A., (Potential) Number of Bidders and Winning Bids: Evidence from the London Bus Tendering Model (2013) Journal of Transport, Economics and Policy, 47 (1), pp. 17-34; Bajari, P., Houghton, S., Tadelis, S., Bidding for Incomplete Contracts: An Empirical Analysis of Adaptation Costs (2014) American Economic Review, 104 (4), pp. 1288-1319; Bajari, P., McMillan, R., Tadelis, S., Auctions versus Negotiations in Procurement: An Empirical Analysis (2009) J Law Econ Organ, 25 (2), pp. 372-399; Bajari, P., Tadelis, S., Incentives versus Transaction Costs: A Theory of Procurement Contracts (2001) RAND Journal of Economics, 32 (3), pp. 387-407; Boehm, F., Olaya, J., Corruption in Public Contracting Auctions: The Role of Transparency in Bidding Processes (2006) Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 77 (4), pp. 431-452; Brown, T.L., Potoski, M., Contract Management Capacity in Municipal and County Governments (2003) Public Administration Review, 63 (2), pp. 153-164; Brown, T.L., Potoski, M., Van Slyke, D.M., Contracting for Complex Products (2010) Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, 20, pp. i41-i58; Bulow, J., Klemperer, P., Auctions versus Negotiations (1996) American Economic Review, 86 (1), pp. 180-194; Burguet, R., Che, Y.-K., Competitive Procurement with Corruption (2004) RAND Journal of Economics, 35 (1), pp. 50-68; Calzolari, G., Spagnolo, G., Relational Contracts and Competitive Screening (2009) CEPR Discussion Paper No., p. 7434; Chong, E., Staropoli, C., Yvrande, A., Auction vs. Negotiation: Looking for New Empirical Evidences (2011) In the Manufacturing of Markets: Legal, Political and Economic Dynamics, , Brousseau E., Glachant J.-M., (eds), Eds., Cambridge University Press; Coviello, D., Guglielmo, A., Giancarlo, The Effect of Discretion on Procurement Performance (2017) Forthcoming in Management Science; De Silva, D.G., Kosmopoulou, G., Lamarche, C., The Effect of Information on the Bidding and Survival of Entrants in Procurement Auctions (2009) Journal of Public Economics, 93 (1-2), pp. 56-72; Decarolis, F., Awarding Price, Contract Performance and Bids Screening: Evidence from Procurement Auctions (2014) American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 6 (1), pp. 108-132; Demsetz, H., Why Regulate Utilities?

Public procurement has a huge potential to stimulate the economy by providing opportunities to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME's), if done correctly. The major bottleneck in the current procurement process is inefficient tendering and selection of bids. Tanzania still doesn't have a fully operational e-procurement platform. This paper analyses how Innovation can be used in Public Procurement to ensure true fairness, competitiveness, transparency and value for money in public projects. Technology is a powerful tool to influence business culture. This paper describes the overall Procurement Management practices used in Tanzania, the challenges, how the procurement process affects public projects (i.e. Time and Cost), how e-evaluation as a component of e-procurement can reduce Time and Cost of Public Projects and Finally the Project Plan and scope for the implementation of an efficient e-tendering system. © 2017 IEEE.;E-evaluation, E-procurement, E-tendering, Innovation, Public Procurement, Public Projects, Tanzania;"Artificial intelligence; Costs; Innovation; e-Evaluation; e-Procurement; E-tendering; Public procurement; Public project; Tanzania; Software engineering";"Kayed, A., Colomb, R., (2002) Book Chapter: B2B Electronic Commerce: The Electronic Tendering in Business to Business Electronic Commerce, , Challenges & Solutions, Idea Group Publishing Hershey, USA; Kerridge, S., Halaris, C., Mentzas, G., Kerridge, S., Virtual tendering and bidding in the construction sector (2000) Proceedings of EC-Web 2000, pp. 379-388. , Springer; Lai, S.C., (2007) E-Tendering with Web Services: A Case Study on the Tendering Process of Building Construction, pp. 582-588. , July, 9-13; Abdullah, A., (2008) Noor: Web-based Prequalification for Tender Management System, 2, pp. 1-6. , June 30 2008-July; (2014) Public Procurement Act, (3). , Government of Tanzania. of; Mamiro, R.G., (2015) Value for Money, the Limping Pillar in Public Procurement-Experience from Tanzania, , Institute of Accountancy, Arusha; Fjeldstad, O.H., Fighting fiscal corruption: Lessons from the Tanzania Revenue Authority (2012) Public Administration and Development, 23 (2), pp. 165-175";Conference Paper;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-85030870749

Comparing external promotion of anti-corruption norms and provisions in civil administration, public finance management and public procurement in Turkey this book identifies the domestic conditions under which external actors can affect real-world outcomes. Providing a comprehensive, empirical account of Turkey's fight against corruption, the book's cross-sectoral analysis explores the power relations between major political actors and bureaucratic state elites, and examines how structural administrative factors filter external pressure for anti-corruption reforms and determine the prospects for institutional change in the Turkish public sector. This welcome addition to literature on Europeanisation and external good governance promotion makes an important contribution to the academic and policy debate regarding the ""politics"" of anti-corruption reforms in Turkey. © 2017 Digdem Soyaltin.

The focus is on specific Europeanle gislation - Procurement Directive 2004/18 on the coordination of procedures for the award of contracts for public works, public supply and public services by public bodies within all EU Member States - however similar issues would arise in other jurisdictions. Design/methodology/approac-hT he procurement processis examined in relation to threes tages of procedure: preparation of specifications, selection of tenderers, and execution of contracts, within each of which some specific risks (red flags) are identified. Findings- Particular risks that may not have been sufficiently addressedin, terms of research or legislation, arise at the first of these stages; accordingly this paper focuses there. Generally, risks are summarisedin terms of insider-driven specifications, low visibility of procurement processes, and ample opportunities for renegotiation of terms. Risks may be increased by innovative procurement practices that have the effect of extending the manoeuvring between tenderers and public bodies, such as competitive dialogue. Researchli mitations/implications- Fraud and corruption risk in public procurementis an area deserving detailed and comparative study, with special attention to the pre-contracting stage. Research on this topic within EU Member States should go hand in hand with enquiry into international procurement, and into the EC's own rules as applied by its institutions and bodies. Practical implications-Suggestions for risk-reduction are put forward in relation to quality standards and pre-award publicity. Originality/value - After some time as the Cinderella of crime policies, large-scale frauds attract greater interest. This paper gives grounds for asking whether, in relation to procurement fraud, a combination of traditional practices and modernisation may outpace anti-fraud measures. © Nikos Passas 2013.";Corruption, European Union, Europeand irectives, Europeanle gislation, Fraud, Public procurement;;"(2006) Fraud Review:Final Report, Attorney General's Office, p. 377. , www.lslo.gov.uk/pdf/FraudReview.pd, London(accessed 2 4 July); Bovis, C., (2005) Reforming the Public Sector: The New Public Procurement Regime, , www.egovmonitor.com/node/1152, eGov monitor/Knowledge Asset Management Ltd, London(accessed 3 1 May); Bueb, J.-P., Fraud and Corruption in Public Procurement, SCPS, Paris, p. 39. , (non-published, informal English translationo f Frenchl anguage textp); Bueb, J.-P., Ehlermann-Cache, N., 'Inventory of mechanisms to disguise corruption in the bidding process and some tools for prevention and detection' (2005) Fighting Corruption and Promoting Integritiy in Public Procurement, Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, pp. 161-174. , www.Lfidic.org/resources/integrity/corrup_proc_OECD-rapport-2005-aase.pdf, Paris; Legal Challenge to Decision to Drop BAE Corruption Inquiry, CAAT and The Corner House (2007) Sturminster Newton, update on proposed judicial review, , www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/subject/corruption/, (accessed2 5 January); (2005) Submission from the Corner House to OGC consultation on draft regulations for EU procurement Directive 2004/18 and proposed guidance, pp. 9-10. , www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/pdf/document/EUprocur.pdf, The Corner House, Sturminster Newton; Stifl Serious Loopholes in ECGD's Anti-Corruption Procedures (2006), www.thecornerhouse.org.uk/item.shtml?x=400043, The Corner House, Sturminster Newton, (accessed 2 1 October); Curtol, F., Pesarin, G., Vander Beken, T., ""Testing the mechanism on EU public procuremenlte gislation"" (2006) European journal on Criminal Policy and Research, 12 (3), pp. 337-364. , www.springerlink.com/content/u55422x3g5x7966, (wac cessed 15 December); Dawson, S., 'Is fraud benchmarking feasible?'

Facing increasing pressure, incumbent governments have adopted international anti-corruption norms and programs in the last two decades. However, the adoption and adaptation of formal institutions tends to remain decoupled from informal behavioral practices, thereby curbing the effectiveness of Europeanization in the Turkish public sector–albeit to varying degrees. The policy comparison of this article shows that external anti-corruption efforts, especially those initiated by the EU, can help domestic actors to address the problem of decoupling when certain domestic factors are present. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;anti-corruption, decoupling, domestic politics, Europeanization, governance, Turkey;;"Acar, M., Emek, U., Building a Clear Government in Turkey: Pillars, Perils and Prospects (2008) Crime Law and Social Change, 49, pp. 185-203; Acar, M., Emek, U., Preventing Corruption in Turkey: Issues, Institutions, Instruments (2009) Preventing Corruption in Asia: Institutional Design and Political Capacity, pp. 164-188. , Gong T., Ma S.K., (eds), London: Routledge; Adaman, F., Is Corruption a Drawback to Turkey's Accession to the European Union?

The growth of state contracts is 3.22 million units worth $ 86.36 billion in 2015 year, which is approximately equal to the GDP of such countries as Slovenia, Ukraine and exceeds the GDP of Belarus by 1.6 times. The size of the Russian economy and the volume of Russian government procurement system is an objective factor complicating the combating corruption and ensuring fair competition. The goals and objectives of the study The positive factors seem to be obvious in recent years: the decrease in prices on the results of competition procedures grew to 8.2% at 2016 (7% at 2015), saving of government budget funds increased by 30%. The increase in the number of administrative offenses for violations in the contract system from 9.02 thousand cases in 2014 to 22.0 and 18.7 thousand cases in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Such growth is an indicator of increasing the effectiveness of preventing corruption. The main violations are reduced to the artificial restriction of competition, allowing overstating the value of goods, works and services, thereby forming the economic conditions of corruption manifestations. Also, when executing government contracts, it is noted that funds are withdrawn beyond the possible audit of the use of allocated funds for the performance of state contracts. Results summary conclusions By our opinion, it is necessary to typify state contracts with mandatory inclusion of budget documentation (estimated costs) as an integral part of the state contract. The analysis also shows that changes in the tax legislation make changes in the effectiveness of corruption counteracting. These innovations should provide for the calculation and payment of profit tax and value added tax (VAT) on state contracts separately from receipts for other reasons (for example, cash flows of sales of goods, works and services received from non-state organizations and private individuals) to the prime contractor and its subcontractors performing at least 70% of the scope of work (services).

Drawing on criminal investigations, the literature has developed several indicators of corruption in public procurements and has put them forward as viable risk indicators. But are they genuinely viable, if only corrupt procurements are analysed? Using a dataset of 192 public procurements — with 96 cases where corruption was detected and 96 cases where corruption was not detected — this paper addresses the identification of significant risk indicators of corruption. We find that only some indicators significantly relate to corruption and that eight of them (e.g. large tenders, lack of transparency and collusion of bidders) can best predict the occurrence of corruption in public procurements. With this paper we successfully tap into one of the most vulnerable areas of criminological research — selecting the right sample — and consequently, our results can help increase the detection of corruption, increase investigation effectiveness and minimize corruption opportunities. © 2016, The Author(s).;Corruption, Public procurement, Selection bias and econometrics;;"Acemoglu, D., Robinson, J.A., (2012) Why nations fail: the origins of power, prosperity, and poverty, , Crown, New York; Aidt, T.S., Corruption, institutions, and economic development (2009) Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 25 (2), pp. 271-291; Alesina, A., Weder, B., Do corrupt governments receive less foreign Aid?

We employ the evolutionary ontology proposed by Kurt Dopfer for conceiving organized crime as the outcome of social, intelligent agents whose strategies evolve through time. To illustrate the use of this ontology we explore the case of corruption in public procurement processes in Colombia in which criminal organizations—groups of corrupt agents—converge spontaneously. The ontology leads to conceive corruption as a knowledge process that adapts according to the evolution of problem-solving rules that are created, used and discarded by agents that seek to attain personal gains by means of public resources. We also use an engineering perspective that favors model-aided design. We built a simulation model that illustrates how the dynamics of such evolving-rules systems can be conceptualized for exploring potential policies. The application of the evolutionary ontology shows why corruption exhibits self-organization: system-level patterns develop from spontaneous interactions that use only local information. Rule dynamics form a changing structure of rule-populations that adapt to novel environmental conditions and generate meta-stable adaptions that explain why corruption persists despite continuous challenges from the environment. This engineering approach forms the ground for proposing policies that instead of addressing the operant level of a social system (according to observed operations and data), should meet the dynamics of rules that govern those operations. Hence, the role of regulators shifts from “controllers” to inventors of selectionist environments that facilitate suitable change through the introduction or promotion of counter-crime rules, the design of selective pressures that favor the evolution of desirable rules and the attention to coordination gaps at the macro-structure. The recognition of organized crime as the outcome of an evolving-rules system changes the questions that orient policy-making and focuses on the redesign of evolving knowledge. Accordingly, our methodological guidelines address such evolutionary dynamics and can be applied to several forms of organized crime. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.;Computer simulation, Corruption, Engineering, Engineering of social systems, Evolution, Policy design, Rule dynamics, Systems;;"Ackoff, R.L., OR: after the post mortem (2001) Syst Dyn Rev, 17 (4), pp. 341-346; Ackoff, R.L., Gharajedaghi, J., Reflections on systems and their models (1996) Syst Res Behav Sci, 13 (1), pp. 13-23; Andreasen, M.M., Modelling—the language of the designer (1994) J Eng Des, 5 (2), pp. 103-115; Bauer, J.M., Herder, P.M., Designing socio-technical systems (2009) Philosophy of technology and engineering sciences, pp. 602-630. , Meijers A, (ed), Amsterdam, North Holland; Bissell, C., Dillon, C., Preface (2012) Ways of thinking, ways of seeing.

This paper explores the market effects of debarment on public procurement. Debarment is found to make little difference in markets with high competition, while in markets with low competition it may deter corruption as long as firms value public procurement contracts in the future and there is a certain risk of being detected in corruption. On the other hand, debarment – when it works – has an anti-competitive effect, and this contributes to facilitate collusion between suppliers. If designed with an understanding of the market mechanisms at play, debarment can deter both collusion and corruption, thus improving the results of public procurement. If so, most current debarment regimes need modification. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;Collusion, Corruption, Procurement;;"ADB/OECD, Curbing Corruption in Public Procurement in Asia and the Pacific: Progress and Challenges in 25 Countries (2006), Asian Development Bank and OECD; Ades, A., Di Tella, R., Rents, competition and corruption (1999) Am.

Methods A two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is carried out based on a sample of Italian public contracts for healthcare infrastructures during the period 2000–2005. First, a smoothed bootstrapped DEA estimator is used to assess the relative efficiency in the implementation of each single infrastructure contract. Second, the determinants of the efficiency scores variability are considered, paying special attention to the effect exerted by ‘environmental’ corruption on different types of contracting authorities. Results Our results show that the performance of the contracts for healthcare infrastructures is significantly affected by ‘environmental’ corruption. Furthermore, healthcare contracting authorities are, on average, less efficient and the negative effect of corruption on efficiency is greater for this type of public procurers. Conclusions The policy recommendation coming out of the study is to rely on ‘qualified’ contracting authorities since not all the public bodies have the necessary expertise to carry on public contracts for healthcare infrastructures efficiently. © 2017;Bootstrap truncated, Corruption, DEA, Efficiency, Infrastructures for healthcare, Public procurement;"attention; bootstrapping; Italy; construction work and architectural phenomena; economics; financial management; fraud; health care facility; hospital management; Italy; legislation and jurisprudence; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Competitive Bidding; Facility Design and Construction; Fraud; Health Facilities; Health Facility Administration; Italy; Models, Statistical";"Estache, A., Trujillo, L., Corruption and infrastructure services: an overview (2009) Utilities Policy, 17 (2), pp. 153-155; Estache, A., Iimi, A., The economics of infrastructure procurement: theory and evidence (2011), Centre for Economic Policy Research London; Flyvbjerg, B., Molloy, E., Delusion, deception and corruption in major infrastructure projects: causes, consequences, cures (2011) International handbook on the economics of corruption, pp. 81-107. , S.

Implementation of SPSE (electronic procurement system) as the e-procurement system in Indonesia is based on the government's intentions towards clean and good governance by fighting corruption, collusion, and nepotism. Procurement in Indonesia is carried out through SPSE, which is developed by LKPP (Government Policy on Procurement of Goods/Services). Although this system has brought many positive effects, there are still found many practices of fraud occurring in the implementation of the system. In this paper, we try to identify these practices and then to systematically categorize and analyze them. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.;;"Developing countries; Electronic data interchange; Purchasing; e-Procurement; E-procurement systems; Electronic procurement systems; Good governances; Indonesia; Public procurement; Crime";"Burton, R.A., (2005) Fighting Corruption and Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement, pp. 23-28. , (OECD Publishing) Improving integrity in public procurement: the role of transparency and accountability; Ampratwum, E.F., The fight against corruption and its implications for development in developing and transition economies (2008) Journal of Money Laundering Control, 11 (1), pp. 76-87; Setyadiharja, R., Budiman, S., Karim, Z., Matridi, R., Junriana, J., Ferizone, F., Nurmandi, A., E-procurement system technology: An analysis in electronic procurement service unit (LPSE) of Kepulauan Riau Province (2014) The Asian Journal of Technology Management (AJTM), 7, pp. 93-107; Kredibel, E-procurement innovation towards free corruption procurement (2011) Kredibel Procurement Magazine, pp. 12-13. , Oct.-Dec; Purwanto, A., Ibty, I., Rofikah, N., Indroyono, P., E-procurement in Indonesia (development services procurement electronic government) (2008) Kemitraan Partnership Dan LPSE Nasional; Nurmandi, A., What is the status of Indonesian e-procurement?

Regional Studies. This paper deals with the open issue regarding centralized versus decentralized public procurement strategy. Using a unique dataset on tender prices of selected drugs for hospital usage provided by a sample of 52 Italian local health service providers (aziende sanitarie locali–ASLs) between 2009 and 2012, the paper tests which procurement system (centralized, decentralized or hybrid) performs better. Controlling for several covariates, including measures of institutional quality and corruption, it finds that centralized and hybrid procurers pay lower prices than decentralized units. Moreover, the results show that in areas in which institutional quality is lower or corruption is higher, the effect of centralization in terms of negotiating lower prices is much stronger, with savings of up to 60% of the price paid by ASLs that procure independently. © 2015 Regional Studies Association.;centralization, decentralization, pharmaceutical spending, public procurement;"centralization; corruption; decentralization; drug; expenditure; health services; price determination; Italy";"Abrate, G., Erbetta, F., Fraquelli, G., Vannoni, D., The cost of corruption in the Italian solid waste industry (2015) Industrial and Corporate Change, 24, pp. 439-465; Albano, G.L., Sparro, M., Flexible strategies for centralized public procurement (2010) Review of Economics and Institutions, 4, pp. 1-32; Arvate, P., Barbosa, K., Gambardella, D., (2013), Generic-branded drug competition and the price of pharmaceuticals in procurement auctions.

Various anti-corruption tools have been developed and efficiently used in the procurement practice, in particular the rules for evaluation of bids for participation in the tender for a state contract. However, following the statutory regulations does not always allow to prevent subjectivity and favoritism of state customers, i.e. the corruption in evaluation of the bids. The purpose of this article is to use the effectively proven methods of fuzzy set theory, disposing the tools for adequate consideration of psychological, legal and other methods for reducing corruption. A model has been developed that ensures localization of the risk of subjective preferences and favoritism of customers in the process of evaluation of bids of the participants of the open tender based on modern mathematical tools of fuzzy logic. Verification of the developed model reveals that it can be used to improve the objectivity of the evaluation of not just bids but also in the process of evaluating the criteria themselves – in particular, the bidder qualification criterion. Although the work with the suggested model requires the development of appropriate competencies from the customers, the use of the existing software allows to efficiently use the developed model, reducing time and laborintensity of the evaluation of bids. In the long term, it ensures the improvement of objectivity for evaluation of bids and therefore localization of corruption risks in the field of public procurement. © 2016 ASERS Publishing System.

We consider two types of stable relations: repeated procurements and connections based on the state ownership of suppliers. On the basis of a large dataset on the procurement of granulated sugar in Russia from 2011 to 2013, we find that for private suppliers, prices of repeated contracts were lower compared to one-time deals when procured through more transparent procedures and higher when procured through non-transparent procedures. For non-transparent procedures, we observe significant overpricing of contracts with state-owned suppliers compared to private suppliers, especially in the case of repeated contracts, whereas for competitive e-auctions, there is only a small difference between the contract prices of state-owned suppliers and private suppliers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;Corruption, Homogeneous good, Procurement procedure, Public procurement, Repeated contract, State-owned enterprise;;"Amore, M.D., Bennedsen, M., The value of local political connections in a low-corruption environment (2013) J.

The test is applied to data concerning the so-called Swedish asphalt cartel, which was discovered in 2001. Using information on submitted bids and procurement characteristics for both the cartel period (1995–2001) and the post-cartel period (2003–2009), the Moran’s I correctly predicts complementary bidding behavior for linear and quadratic specifications when such behavior is likely to exist, and rejects such behavior when it’s unlikely to be present. Remarkably, the Moran’s I also correctly indicates and rejects complementary bidding on the basis of information on the separate bids alone. © 2016, The Author(s).;Antitrust, Auction, Cartel and collusion, Complementary bidding, Public procurement, Spatial econometrics;;"Abrantes-Metz, R.M., Bajari, P., Screens for conspiracies and their multiple applications (2009) Antitrust, 24 (1), pp. 66-71; Abrantes-Metz, R.M., Froeb, L.M., Geweke, J.F., Taylor, C.T., A variance screen for collusion (2006) Int.

The goal of creation, introduction and management of the Georgian Electronic Government Procurement (Ge-GP) system was delegated upon the State Procurement Agency, which succeeded in ensuring the development of the software for the Ge-GP system under the assistance of the National Agency of Public Registry. The Ge-GP system was created within less than one year. From the first of December, 2010 all the paper-based tenders were abolished and electronic procurement has become the single platform. Through the introduction of electronic procurement platform, the Georgian procurement system has become considerably more transparent and nondiscriminatory, encouraging free and fair competition and minimizing the risk of corruption.

A number of cases related to corruption in public procurement in the country have been highlighted by media on regular basis. These incidents raise questions regarding robustness of the procurement framework in vogue in the country. Though no special legislative framework dealing with public procurement exists in the country, the administrative guidelines on the subject are quite exhaustive. Procurement is not a state subject; hence law can be made by the Centre for entire country. However, no separate law governing public procurement has been enacted in India. However, public procurement in India is not bereft of its share of issues. Multiplicity of instructions, absence of procurement law and singular emphasis on upfront value of acquisition without considering life cycle cost mars public procurement in India. Further, social and environmental sustainability has also not received the attention it deserves. Studies highlight that migration of public procurement to Internet could provide us savings of up to 25% by streamlining 30% of Indian Union Budget spent on provisioning of goods / services. However, any such endeavor has 70% chances of failure. With only 13% e-procurement research focusing on public sector make matter worse.

This topic has been increasingly at the center of the Italian legal scholars’debate, especially in the last few years. In particular, after analyzing the oldest main legal scholar’s theories according to which public administration always has an obligation to quash ex officio its own unlawful decision, the paper explains why, over the years, Courts and legal scholarship in Italy have interpreted this power mainly as a discretionary power. As a consequence, also Article 21-nonies of the Law No 241/1990 (Administrative Procedure Law) on the ex officio annulment-as amended in 2005-was a kind of restatement of this consolidated jurisprudential and scholar trend. However, Courts have continued to infer that there is an obligation on the public administration to quash an unlawful administrative decision in a few hypotheses: when an administrative decision is adopted in breach of the EU law, when the ex officio annulment can save or reduce spending costs for the public administration, when administrative decision is adopted in breach of planning law. The paper critically analyzes all these cases. Furthermore, this contribute analyzes recent rules that seem to introduce new hypothesis of “dutiful ex officio annulment”, such as, for example, Art. 21-nonies of the Law No 241/1990, as amended by the Law No. 164/2014; Art. 52 of the Legislative Decree No. 174/2016 (s.c. Code of Accounting Justice); Art. 243-bis of the Legislative Decree No. 163/2006 (the former Italian Code on Public Procurement); the original version of Art. 211 of the Legislative Decree 50/2016 (new Italian Code on Public Procurement); and Art. 2 of the Law No. 241/1990, as amended by the Law no. 190/2012 (Italian Anti-corruption Law). Against this backdrop, the paper infers that the ex officio annulment is still, as a general rule, a discretionary power and that public administration only has the duty to start the ex officio annulment procedure, without any obligation to quash an unlawful administrative act. However, the paper lives open the door to some new trends that might occur in the future. © 2017, University of Urbino.

Assuming that business structure and processes follow business strategy, the main goals of the paper are to present the business strategy model in the enterprise architecture language, i.e., ArchiMate and to emphasize the strategy formulation value for the business process modeling. © ISD 2017.;ArchiMate, Business analytics, Business architecture, Business strategy, Process modeling, Public procurement;"Information systems; Information use; Management information systems; Modeling languages; Strategic planning; Archimate; Business process model; Business strategy; Business structures; Enterprise Architecture; Local policies; Public procurement; Strategy formulations; Information management";"Ahlemann, F., Legner, Ch, Schafczuk, D., The need for enterprise architecture management (EAM) (2012) Strategic Enterprise Architecture Management, Challenges, Best Practices and Future Developments, pp. 5-13. , Ahlemann, F., Stettiner, E., Messerschmidt, M., Legner, Ch.

There are several governmental investments in this area to accomplish the principle of integrity and to achieve more transparency. In Portugal, in the e-government context, the strategy was the adoption of electronic platforms for procurement, as the main reinforcement measure of transparency in public procurement. Through an exploratory literature review, based on OCDE recommendations and European Union official reports, this paper aims at contributing to the discussion on the use of information and communication technology, specifically electronic platforms, in Portuguese public procurement. While the gains are potentially significant, it should be noted that the implementation of the principle of integrity implies articulated measures of technological and political dimension as well as organizational culture. © 2017 International Business Information Management Association, IBIMA.

It also undermines basic principles and values like equality, non-discrimination, human dignity, and social justice - especially in African countries where democratic systems and institutional arrangements are less developed than in most European, Asian and American countries. Corruption occurs in both the public and private sectors and affects human rights by deteriorating institutions and diminishing public trust in government. Corruption impairs the ability of governments to fulfil their obligations and ensure accountability in the implementation and protection of human rights - particularly socio-economic rights pertinent to the delivery of economic and social services. This is because corruption diverts funds into private pockets - impeding delivery of services, and thereby perpetuating inequality, injustice and unfairness. This considered, the focus of this paper is on public procurement corruption. It is argued that by applying a human rights-based approach to combating public procurement corruption, the violation of human rights - particularly socio-economic rights - can be significantly reduced. Through a human rights-based approach, ordinary people can be empowered to demand transparency, accountability and responsibility from elected representatives and public officials - particularly those involved in public procurement.

For the detection of ALPs, the Tunisian Competition Council (TCC) is still working with a classical approach which does not rely on a scientific decision rule and may lead to wrong decisions. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new approach for detecting ALPs in public procurement using control charts, which works as follows. In a first step, a control chart for reference prices of goods and services is constructed. In a second step, the proposed bidders' tenders are compared with the results of the constructed control chart. Bidders' prices located below the lower control limit are considered as ALPs, while those situated above the upper control limit are considered as cover biddings. To show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we applied it to two real cases of Tunisian public procurement. Results demonstrated that our proposed approach performs better than the TCC's approach not only in detecting ALPs, but also in revealing cover biddings.

However, the complexity of post-apartheid South African politics has sometimes prevented allegations and suspicions of corruption from being adequately dealt with by the law. This article examines the legal framework used to combat public procurement corruption in South Africa. Using a comparative approach, the article also examines the legal framework of Hong Kong – with a view to identifying lessons that South Africa can learn therefrom. Such lessons include but are not limited to Hong Kong’s specific laws dedicated to public procurement, its particular legislative and institutional features, its commendable constitutional commitment to eradicating corruption, and the fact that Hong Kong’s rules pertaining to procurement processes are more consistent and are not hidden in several legislative prescripts. South Africa may also do well to learn from the successes of Hong Kong’s iconic anti-corruption agency, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) – in attempting to model its own anti-corruption agency. © 2017, North-West Unversity.

It is demonstrated that the increased use of electronic auction helped to transform the civil society (social auditors) into a competent subject of public procurement markets. We suggested a hypothesis that the customers' qualification and the transparency of the public procurement system are the dominant factors of their efficiency. In order to justify it we have analyzed the results of a survey of civil servants, increasing their qualification at the Pilot Procurement Center of the Southern Federal University. The efficiency is assessed in terms of budgetary savings. At the preparation of grids, using the software Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, we determined the degree of correlation between the efficiency of public procurement and qualification of customers. Their high dependence has been proven. This, under the conditions of high responsibility of contract managers and contract service, objectively requires - combined with the high rotation under the conditions of a new political business cycle starting in Russia - a systematic training of civil servants. The increase in the share of the most transparent methods of procurement, such as electronic auctions, and the common increase of the information transparency at the introduction of the Unified Information System of Public Procurement and the formation of the contract system, have significantly expanded the capabilities of civil society and public auditors to test the corrupt behavior of customers and to withdraw such procurements. However, this requires enhancing the competence of social auditors. © 2017.;Corruption, Education, Efficiency of procurement, Electronic auction, Public control, Public procurement, Transparency;;"(2016) Analiz effektivnosti razmeshcheniya zakaza dlya gosudarstvennykh i munitsipal'nykh nuzhd Rostovskoy oblasti [The Analysis of the Efficiency of Order Placement for State and Municipal Needs of the Rostov Region], , http://www.donland.ru/Donland/Pages/View.aspx?pageid=124053&mid=128713&itemId=126924, Retrieved October 12 2016; Belokrylov, K.A., Korytsev, M.A., [The Problems of Transplantation and Modification of Economic Institutions in Public Procurement of Modern Russia] (2014) Journal of Economic Regulation, 5 (2), pp. 33-46; Belokrylov, K.A., Korytsev, M.A., (2006) Mekhanizmy povysheniya effektivnosti gosudarstvennykh raskhodov [Mechanisms of Increase of Efficiency of Public Spending], , Rostov-on-Don: Publishing house of Rostov University; Boehm, F., Olaya, J., Corruption in Public Contracting Auction: The Role of Transparency in Bidding Processes (2006) Annals of Public and Cooperative economics, 77 (4), pp. 431-452; Bossce, P., Van den Gupta, P., Gtuierrez, H., Gupta, A., (2014) Solving the Reshoring Problem, , Supply Chain Management Review, 1.

How (not) to use political finance regulations to counter public procurement corruption;2017;Slavonic and East European Review;95;1;;76;116;;5;10.5699/slaveasteurorev2.95.1.0076;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021173085&doi=10.5699%2fslaveasteurorev2.95.1.0076&partnerID=40&md5=93f5832a3433aa2a203bb564c32fe709;There are widespread perceptions and countless documented cases of tight-knit networks of politicians and businessmen colluding in the allocation of public procurement contracts in return for political party donations. In the absence of systematic evidence, neither the magnitude of the problem nor the effectiveness of policies curbing such corruption is well-understood. In order to advance our understanding of these phenomena, this paper tests whether political financing regulations can contribute to controlling corruption in public procurement. We utilize aggregated official micro-level data on almost 3 million contracts awarded across twenty-nine European countries from 2009 to 2014 to measure the risk of high-level institutionalized corruption using novel proxy indicators. Legislation regulating political finances is directly measured by coding national laws from 2009 to 2014. In cross-country panel regression and difference-in-difference models, we find that introducing additional political financing restrictions does not have a measurable negative impact on public procurement corruption risks. In fact, the observed effect is positive in most models. The observed relationship remains the same for most constitutive components of political financing regulations. Several challenges remain for a conclusive judgement on political party financing regulations' effectiveness in curbing corruption, such as measuring implementation rather than legislation, allowing for a longer lead-time for regulatory impact, or considering institutional inter-dependencies.;;;"Della Porta, D., Vannucci, A., (1999) Corrupt Exchanges: Actors, Resources, Mechanisms of Political Corruption, p. 2. , New York; (2013) Money in Politics: Sound Political Competition and Trust in Government, , OECD, Paris; Boas, T.C., Hidalgo, F.D., Richardson, N.P., The spoils of victory: Campaign donations and government contracts in Brazil (2014) Journal of Politics, 76 (2), pp. 415-429; Bromberg, D., Can vendors buy influence?

Nevertheless, making data freely available is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for improving transparency. Fragmentation of OGD due to diverse processes adopted by different administrations and inconsistency within data affect opportunities to obtain valuable information. In this article, we propose a solution based on linked data to integrate existing datasets and to enhance information coherence. We present an application of such principles through a semantic layer built on Italian PP information available as OGD. As result, we overcame the fragmentation of datasources and increased the consistency of information, enabling new opportunities for analyzing data to fight corruption and for raising competition between companies in the market. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.;Data consistency, Data integration, Linked data, Public procurement;"Data handling; Semantic Web; Transparency; Data consistency; Data inconsistencies; Data-sources; Government spending; Linked datum; Public procurement; Semantic layer; Semantic technologies; Data integration";"Álvarez, J.M., Labra, J.E., Calmeau, R., Marín, Á., Marín, J.L., Query expansion methods and performance evaluation for reusing linking open data of the european public procurement notices (2011) CAEPIA 2011.

Using an evolutionary method, we identified the stages of the formation of the national procurement system and its electronification. The result has shown that since 2006, mandatory electronic auctions ensured great increase in the transparency of the Russian public procurement system. Electronic Public Procuremet were considered as a component of implementation of the general concept of electronic state. Still, introduction of electronic auctions did not much contribute to corruption decrease in the Russian public procurement system. The objective of this paper is, based on identification and analysis of the stages of public procurement system's restructuring in Russia, to assess its effects on the expansion of electronic procurement ensuring growing transparency and decreasing corruption. This purpose requires solving the following tasks: - to identify the stages of evolution of electronic public procurement in the Russian Federation; - to evaluate the effects of the introduction of the contract system on the degree of electronification of trading; - on the basis of the expert method application to identify the influence of the contract system on the reduction of the level of corruption in the public procurement system of the Russian Federation. For corruption testing purposes, we used the expert method to analyze the results of the experts' questionnaire in Pilot public procurement center of the Southern Federal University. The result revealed that even the transition to the single contract system did not reduce the level of corruption in the public procurement system. Based on the results of the study we offered measures to increase the transparency of the public procurement system and reduce corruption, in particular, development of public procurement monitoring system and electronification of open contests along with electronic auctions. The novelty of the study is rationalizing the effect of increasing transparency on the opportunities of exercising public control by the civil society over the public procurement system and identification of inefficient procurement. © Serials Publications Pvt.

While the economic reasoning behind these rules makes sense when considering each one of them in isolation, their impact is weakened when they are opposing each other. Competition authorities are narrowly mandated to control competition, and they do not seek out corruption. For criminal law investigators problems are created if they interfere (because it would undermine the leniency program); conversely, there are problems if they stay away (because that would undermine enforcement of corruption and other economic crimes). We propose to strengthen the regulation of corporate misconduct through better collaboration and integration of the other law enforcement functions and institutions that exist. The first step is to maintain and share a centralized database on firms' offenses and settlements with antitrust and procurement authorities. The second step is to expand the mandate and competence of competition authorities to search for, and react against, corruption.";;;"Wils, W., Is Criminalization of EU Competition Law the Answer?

The weaknesses of the system are identified by comparing opinions of both suppliers and procurers based on a large set of survey data and structured interviews. The research analysis showed slight variations in opinions among micro, small and medium-sized companies as well as significant differences among the opinions of successful and unsuccessful bidders. The main reason why SMEs do not have confidence in the public procurement system is corruption related. Other Balkan countries, which are in the process of accessing the EU and struggling with corruption, may find lessons learned from BiH instructive in order to improve national public procurement systems.

This article emphasizes the important interplay between politics and bureaucracy. It suggests that corruption risks are lower when bureaucrats' careers do not depend on political connections but on their peers. We test this hypothesis with a novel measure of career incentives in the public sector-using a survey of more than 18,000 public sector employees in 212 European regions-And a new objective corruption risk measure including over 1.4 million procurement contracts. Both show a remarkable subnational variation across Europe. The study finds that corruption risks are indeed significantly lower where bureaucrats' career incentives exclusively follow professional criteria. In substantial terms, moving EU regions so that bureaucrats' merit and effort would matter as much as in, for example, Baden- Wüttemberg (90th percentile) could lead to a 13-20 billion Euro savings per year. © 2016 by the Southern Political Science Association.

Budak J.;"13002903100;";Corruption in public procurement: Do we need a new research model for Croatia? [Korupcija u javnoj nabavi: Trebamo li novi model istraživanja za hrvatsku?];2016;Ekonomski Pregled;67;4;;306;327;;1;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84992387971&partnerID=40&md5=71742674765259e50c1a20abc57ec0a0;The paper examines corruption risks in public procurement in Croatia. The study was motivated by the dilemma of how EU membership contributed to fighting corruption in public procurement in Croatia since the anti-corruption momentum after joining the EU was lost,while there is a growing interest in public procurement in the context of economic imbalances and the new EU regulations on public procurement. The objective of the analysis is to establish a new research framework to assess corruption in public procurement in Croatia. A review of relevant literature and existing research indicate that their focus does not match the particularities of public procurement in Croatia. In the paper we argue that an effective suppression of specific corruption risks in Croatia is not guaranteed by the principles of public procurement and EU regulations. The misuse in the system of public procurement will not be eliminated by formal regulations in favour of the most economically advantageous offer,centralized procurement,and e-procurement. In conclusion,findings confirm the need for a new model of research of corruption in public procurement,which would take into account the specifics of implementation in Croatian context. The paper offers policy recommendations and provides lines for future research. © 2016,Ekonomski Pregled.

It argues that corruption in public procurement can be explained by the creation and development of “corrupt procurement coalitions” (CPCs). Functioning as a network built by corruption entrepreneurs seeking to “milk” the procurement process, a CPC must accomplish three interrelated tasks to succeed: 1) identifying which members to include and organizing interactions of said members, 2) generating and redistributing benefits, and 3) evading internal and external control. CPCs are structured in an inner/peripheral configuration, where the inner network controls the core activities, and the peripheral networks can be activated at will when illegal tasks need to be externalized. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.;;;"(2011) About Us.

A public official may often worry about situations where his/her procurement project will not be successfully implemented. Based on a simplified theoretical treatment and on case studies of kansei-dango, it is argued that the desire to avert the risk of unsuccessful procurement resulting from the “experience goods” status of procured goods and/or services may be one reason for bid-rigging. Based on this understanding of kansei-dango, we discuss some implications for policies to restrain this type of corruption. © 2016 by Pracademics Press.;;;"Arozamena, L., Weinschelbaum, F., The Effect of Corruption on Bidding Behavior in First-Price Auctions (2009) European Economic Review, 53 (6), pp. 645-657; Athey, S., Bagwell, K., Sanchirico, C., Collusion and Price Rigidity (2004) Review of Economic Studies, 71, pp. 317-349; Auriol, E., Corruption in Procurement and Public Purchase (2006) International Journal of Industrial Organization, 24, pp. 867-885; Burguet, R., Che, Y.-K., Competitive Procurement with Corruption (2004) Rand Journal of Economics, 35 (1), pp. 50-68; Burguet, R., Perry, M.K., Bribery and Favoritism by Auctioneers in Sealed-Bid Auctions (2007) B.

Particularistic transactions can be identified in three different situations: uncompetitive awards of public contracts when there is only one “competitive” tender, when public money is spent on contracts supplied by politically connected firms, and a situation of capture in which one private contractor obtains a disproportionate share of contracts issued by some public agency. This present research has tested for the relevance of those three types of particularistic transactions that signal government favouritism as they apply to the Romanian construction sector for the period from 2007-2013, and to do so has made use of original public procurement databases. Furthermore, it will be proposed here that the “kickback”—a percentage of particularistic awarded values—can be used as a measurement of corruption. Even conservatively estimated, kickbacks account for much of the cost borne by any society that fails to eradicate corruption. For our purposes here, amounts of kickbacks at county level have been controlled against criminal convictions for corruption at county level. As a result, data analysis provides strong evidence that kickbacks based on particularistic allocation of public funds are indeed relevant in the measurement of corruption, and the steps used to evaluate kickbacks can be used just as well for other countries. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.;Corruption, EU funding, Government favouritism, Kickback, Public procurement;;"Amore, M.D., Bennedsen, M., The value of local political connections in a low-corruption environment (2013) Journal of Financial Economics, 110, pp. 387-402; Ancutescu, I., România capitalismului de cumetrie: patru milionari din cinci au supt de la stat (2014) Adevarul newspaper, , http://adev.ro/n3mewx; Banerjee, A., Hanna, R., Mullainathan, S., Corruption, The Handbook of Organizational Economics, Ed.

Using publicly available electronic public procurement records in Hungary, we identify “red flags” in the public procurement process and link them to restricted competition and recurrent contract award to the same company. We use this method to create a corruption indicator at contract level that can be aggregated to the level of individual organisations, sectors, regions and countries. Because electronic public procurement data is available in virtually all developed countries from about the mid-2000s, this method can generate a corruption index based on objective data that is consistent over time and across countries. We demonstrate the validity of the corruption risk index by showing that firms with higher corruption risk score had relatively higher profitability, higher ratio of contract value to initial estimated price, greater likelihood of politicians managing or owning them and greater likelihood of registration in tax havens, than firms with lower scores on the index. In the conclusion we discuss the uses of this data for academic research, investigative journalists, civil society groups and small and medium business. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.;Grand corruption, Hungary, Indicator, Public procurement;;"Amaral, M., Saussier, S., Yvrande-Billon, A., Auction procedures and competition in public services: the case of urban public transport in France and London (2009) Utilities Policy, 17, pp. 166-175; Andersson, S., Heywood, P.M., The politics of perception: use and abuse of transparency International’s approach to measuring corruption (2009) Political Studies, 57, pp. 746-767; Arndt, C., Oman, C., (2006) Uses and abuses of governance indicators, , OECD, Paris; Auriol, E., Flochel, T., Straub, S., Public Procurement and Rent-Seeking: The Case of Paraguay (No. 11–224) (2011) TSE Working Papers: 11–224, , Toulouse: Toulouse School of Economics (TSE); Borgatti, S.P., Everett, M.G., Johnson, J.C., (2013) Analyzing social networks, , London: Sage; Charron, N., Dijkstra, L., Lapuente, V., Mapping Quality of Government in the European Union: A Study of National and Sub-National Variation (No. 2010:22) (2010) Gothenburg; Charron, N., Dahlström, C., Fazekas, M., Lapuente, V., Carriers, connections, and corruption risks in Europe.

The enterprises choose between these two types of political connections according to the respective profitability of each. We make use of primary data collected in 2014 from enterprises that take part in Burkina Faso’s public procurements to analyze the expenses and profits linked to each of these political connections. The database has helped us to identify three categories of enterprises according to the type of political connection being implemented. The first category of enterprises financially supports only political parties, and the second finances only politicians. The third category is composed of those that finance both politicians and political parties. The data show that the enterprises that establish both types of political connections bear more expenses. These enterprises also earn more public contracts. The difference in treatment between these three types of enterprises is only viewed at the level of the number of public contracts obtained. This process allows us to say that the only advantage linked to the establishment of political connection in Burkina Faso is the profitability linked to government procurements. Our data do not address the hypothesis of tax reduction as a benefit of a given category. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.;Burkina Faso, corruption, political behavior, Politically connected enterprises, public contracts;;"Ahlstrom, D., Bruton, G.D., Lui, S.Y., Navigating China’s changing economy: Strategies for private firms (2000) Business Horizons, 43, pp. 5-15; Akouwerabou, B.D., Bako, P., (2013) Government contracts and small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in Burkina Faso: What governorship?, , ICEB Research Report Unpublished; Ansolabehere, S., De Figueiredo, J.M., Snyder, J.M., Why is there so little money in U.S. Politics?

That debate in turn has been bounded by the conventional political science preoccupation with civil society, party, and state relations. This article contends that these conventions have tended to deflect our attention from the contemporary dynamics of political corruption in Central Europe, in which the commercial sector is a major player and the gains of political players primarily private. Building on the assumption that party systemic adaptations are contingent on changing power relations within the political economy, this article offers an ideal typical party model to characterise the behaviour of political parties that preside over the continuous marketization of the state. A ""corporate brokerage party"" directs its strategic focus to the private sector and acts primarily as a broker of the state’s power in the marketplace, whether expressed through privatisation, regulation, or public procurement. Using the Czech Republic as a critical case study for Central Europe, the evidence suggests that politicians able to direct allocation to the private sector with low regulatory constraints act less evidently as technocratic brokers of the public interest, partisan constituency, or organisation builders and more as private agents. © 2016 Sage Publications.";Corporate brokerage party system, Corporate state capture, Corruption, Czech Republic, Party-state relationship;;"Hellman, J.S., Jones, G., Kaufmann, D., (2000) Seize the State, Seize the Day: State Capture, Corruption, and Influence in Transition, pp. 2-3. , Policy Research Working Paper 2444 (World Bank; Nunberg, B., (1999) The State after Communism; Administrative Transitions in Central and Eastern Europe, , Washington, DC: World Bank; Goetz, K.H., Wallmann, H., Governmentalizing Central Executives in Post-Communist Europe: A Four-Country Comparison (2001) Journal of European Public Policy, 8 (6), pp. 864-887; Kopecký, P., Mair, P., Spirova, M., (2012) Party Patronage and Party Government in European Democracies, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Hellman, J.S., Winner Takes All: The Politics of Partial Reform in Post-Communist Transitions (1998) World Politics, 50, pp. 203-234; Grzymała-Busse, A., Jones-Luong, P., Reconceptualizing the State: Lessons from Post-Communism (2002) Politics and Society, 30, pp. 529-554; Grzymała-Busse, A., (2007) Rebuilding Leviathan, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; O’Dwyer, C., (2006) Runaway State-Building: Patronage Politics and Democratic Development, , Baltimore, MD: John Hopkins University Press; Frye, T., (2010) Building States and Markets after Communism: The Perils of Polarized Democracy, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Biezen, I., Kopecký, P., The Cartel Party and the State: Party-State Linkages in European Democracies (2014) Party Politics, 20, pp. 170-182; Kopecký, Party Patronage, p. 367; Knack, S., Kisunko, G., Trends in corruption and regulatory burden in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (2011) World Bank Study, 59465, p. 20; Ganev, V., (2007) Preying on the State: The Transformation of Bulgaria after 1989, , Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press; MacDonald, R., Majeed, M., (2014) Causes of Corruption in European Countries: History, Law and Political Stability, , http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_218412_en.pdf, draft, 3 (accessed 20 February; Katz, R.S., Mair, P., Changing Models of Party Organisation and Party Democracy: The Emergence of the Cartel Party (1995) Party Politics, 1 (1), pp. 5-29 and 9; Panebianco, A., (1988) Political Parties, Organization and Power, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Koole, R., Cadre-Party, Catch-all or Cartel?

These corporations have paid for their wrong understanding of the global business new rules. Instead of criticizing the US hegemony, we should better learn from those settlements and change our legislation in order to protect our corporations which are already facing global enforcement. French corporations must be fully aware of the importance of discovery and e-discovery proceedings in the United States and Great-Britain; without this discovery culture, they may leave 'smoking guns' behind them difficult to control. Compliance programs are often 'paper policies'. An effective compliance program implies regular testing of the process. In England, an adequate compliance program may be used as a defense according to the Bribery Act 2010. Self-reporting and cooperation are the key points to understand the US and UK legal system. Suspicions coming to a company's attention must immediately lead to disclosure to the US officials. 'Comply' implies internal investigation and a proactive approach before receiving subpoenas. Cooperation increases the company's chance of reducing the amount of the penalty or to obtain a declination, the US authorities deciding to drop the charges. The prosecutor plays a key role in the US system. While judicial review of settlements is almost inexistent, there is a trend of some Judges of the US District Court for the District of New York and Columbia to refuse to 'rubberstamp' deals when they consider that giving the court's stamp would lead to approve 'over-lenient prosecutorial action'. US guilty plea, DPA proceedings are different from French traditions but should be transposed in France in order to build a French credible system of justice. Slowness of judicial procedures in France proves detrimental both to enforcement authorities that lose credibility and to corporations. Moreover, harmonised settlements are a means to help the implementation of the ""international"" double jeopardy principles to multi-national corporations which face multiple prosecutions for the same facts in various jurisdictions. The French Code of Criminal Procedure contains a provision called a « CRPC » (Comparution sur Reconnaissance Préalable de Culpabilité), sort of ""appearance based on recognition of guilt"". However CRPC procedures contain little negotiation and are based on admission of guilt. Such a conviction presents the collateral consequence of excluding corporations convicted from public procurements. This is why the Deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) should be adapted in the French legal system and should imply a judicial review at every stage of the proceedings, as it is already the case in the UK. The Crimes and Court Act 2013 indeed has created a DPA with judicial scrutiny. Such an adaptation of our traditional system requires several conditions. First French judges should be competent in economic matters which is not always the case for the moment because they do not have in-depth knowledge of business, unlike their English or American counterparts who benefit from porosity between the different legal professions. France must also accelerate the flow of its legal elite. Second, and paradoxically, French corporations have a need for credible prosecution in their country as some of them have been dismissed from international calls for tender on the grounds that French law did not provide enough safeguards against corruption. Third, we need a new status for the French prosecutor with the ability to hold negotiations and to interact with their foreign counterparts and white-collar defense lawyers. Fourth, we also need to imagine a ""second chance"" justice system which can grant credit for prompt disclosure and for a robust compliance program able to detect and prevent bribery. Lastly, France must create an in-house lawyer status to meet the challenge of globalization.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyzes actual procurement fraud incidents and identifies in which phase of the contract management process the fraud occurred and which internal control component was associated with the fraud scheme. Findings: The fraud incidents generally occurred during the source selection and the contract administration phases and involved the control activities, monitoring and control environment components of internal control. Research limitations/implications: The fraud incidents are analyzed using contract management and internal control frameworks adopted by the US Government. Recommendations are developed for improving contracting processes and internal controls as an approach to deterring and detecting procurement fraud and may be applicable to other international public procurement bodies. Practical implications: Governments are ensuring auditability in public procurement as a means of improving agency governance. The research findings suggest that an emphasis on capable contracting processes and effective internal controls should be adopted for fighting procurement fraud. Social implications: Ensuring auditability in public procurement has a far-reaching effect in society. The value of capable processes and effective internal controls is gaining much attention in public agencies, as they strive for accountability, integrity and transparency in their governance processes. Originality/value: By emphasizing capable processes and effective internal controls, governments can apply a strategic approach to detecting and deterring fraud and thus ensure that government monies are spent in the most effective and efficient ways. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;;;"(2014) Report to the nations on occupational fraud and abuse: 2014 global fraud study, , www.acfe.com/rttn/docs/2014-report-to-nations.pdf, Austin, TX; Basheka, B.C., Bisangabasaija, E., Determinants of unethical public procurement in local government systems of Uganda: a case study (2010) International Journal of Procurement Management, 3 (1), pp. 91-104; Basheka, B.C., Oluka, P.N., Karyeija, G.K., The nature and forms of public procurement corruption in Ugandaâ€™s local government systems: implications for good governance debate (2013) International Journal of Procurement Management, 6 (6), pp. 684-701; Bierstaker, J.L., Brody, R.G., Pacini, C., Accountantsâ€™ perceptions regarding fraud detection and prevention methods (2006) Managerial Auditing Journal, 21 (5), pp. 520-535; Button, M., Gee, J., Brooks, G., Measuring the cost of fraud: an opportunity for the new competitive advantage (2011) Journal of Financial Crime, 19 (1), pp. 65-75; Castillo, J.C., Flanigan, E.M., (2014) Procurement fraud: a knowledge-level analysis of contracting personnel, , www.nps.edu/library, Masterâ€™s thesis; Cavas, C.P., 3 Admirals Censured in â€˜Fat Leonardâ€™ Scandal (2015) Defense News, , www.defensenews.com/story/defense/naval/navy/2015/02/10/navy-admirals-scandal-fat-leonard-gdma-flags-corruption-bribery-carrier-reagan-deployment-singapore/23167837/; Cavas, C.P., (2015) Fat Leonardâ€™ scandal jams up dozens of US navy flag moves, , www.defensenews.com/story/defense/naval/navy/2015/02/08/navy-gdma-glenn-defense-marine-asia-fat-leonard-scandal-investigation-justice-admirals-flags/22978631/, Defense News; Chacko, S., DoD contract audits plunge in quest for thoroughness (2012) Federal Times, , http://archive.federaltimes.com/article/20120611/DEPARTMENTS01/306110001/DoD-contract-audits-plunge-quest-thoroughness; Chang, P.W., (2013) Analysis of contracting processes, internal controls, and procurement fraud schemes, , MBA thesis, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA:; Cohen, S., Eimicke, W., (2008) The Responsible Contract Manager: Protecting the Public Interest in An Outsourced World, , Georgetown University Press, Washington, DC:; (2013) Internal control â€“ integrated framework, Executive summary, , www.coso.org/documents/Internal%20Control-Integrated%20Framework.pdf; Crawford, L.H., Helm, J., Government and governance: the value of project management in the public sector (2009) Project Management Journal, 40 (1), pp. 73-87; Creswell, J.W., (2003) Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches, , Sage, Thousand Oaks, CA:; (2015) Certification and core plus development guides, , http://icatalog.dau.mil/onlinecatalog/CareerLvl.aspx; (2013) Managersâ€™ internal control program procedures, , Instruction 5010.40, Washington, DC, 30 May; (2009) Summary of DoD Office of Inspector General Audits Acquisitions and Contract Administration, , DoDIG, Washington, DC:; (2014) Approaches for Establishing Fraud Risk Assessment Programs and Conducting Fraud Audit Risk Assessments within the Department of Defense, , DoDIG, Washington, DC:; (2013) Encyclopedia of ethical failures, , http://cryptome.org/2013/07/dod-ethicsfail.Pdf, Standards of Conduct Office; Dorn, N., Levi, M., White, S., Do European procurement rules generate or prevent crime?

This paper develops a new conceptual and analytical framework for gauging state capture based on microlevel contractual networks in public procurement. To this end, it establishes a novel measure of corruption risk in government contracting focusing on the behavior of individual organizations. Then, it identifies clusters of high-corruption-risk organizations in the full contractual network of procuring authorities and their suppliers using formal social network analysis. Densely connected clusters of high-corruption-risk organizations are denoted as the domain of state capture. The paper demonstrates the power of the new analytical framework by exploring how the radical centralization of the governing elite following the 2010 elections in Hungary affected centralization of state capture. Findings indicate the feasibility and usefulness of such microlevel approach to corruption and state capture. Better understanding the network structure of corruption and state capture opens new avenues for research and policy on anticorruption, budget deficit, market competition, and quality of democracy.

Controlling for project characteristics, for observed and unobserved heterogeneity at municipality level, our main results suggest that projects that are more complex are more likely to be procured with negotiated procedures. On average, a rise in the project complexity index from the 25th to the 75th percentile of its distribution increases the probability of procuring the project with a negotiated procedure by about 6%-8%. However, our results also suggest that the impact of complexity might be more relevant in the case of projects procured by municipalities located in provinces characterized by low levels of corruption. Moreover, we also find that complex projects are associated to longer delays in their execution, larger rebates and to higher probabilities to be awarded to local firms. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.;Complexity, Corruption, Public procurement;;"Abrate, G., Erbetta, F., Fraquelli, G., Vannoni, D., The cost of corruption in the Italian solid waste industry (2015) Ind.

Data are consistent with the corruption channel-cash is tunneled to politicians in exchange for procurement contracts-and inconsistent with alternative channels.

The agreements have significant potential to improve procedural efficiency in public procurement, but are complex to operate. Inadequate preparation and implementation can also frustrate their potential both to tackle waste, abuse and corruption and to enhance value for money. In this enlightening book, Gian Luigi Albano and Caroline Nicholas look at the key decisions required for designing and using framework agreements and address both legal and economic issues to give the reader a clear understanding of the planning, variables and flexibility needed for efficient implementation. This book will be of interest to policy makers, lawyers and public procurement practitioners who want to deepen their understanding of the legal and economic issues surrounding framework agreements. © Gian Luigi Albano and Caroline Nicholas 2016.

However, experiential studies relating to the adoption of e-procurement systems by public sector organisations in developing countries appears neglected. This study, through empirical research, aims to examine the level of adoption of e-procurement in Nigeria with the view of gaining an understanding of the drivers, benefits, barriers, critical success factors, organisational performance post implementation and the impact of e-procurement utilization on curtailing corruption in public procurement. Results were obtained using a web-based survey, sent to 174 interviewees operating in the e-Procurement departments of Nigerian public sector organisations. In total, 74 responses were received, with results identifying that the majority of those surveyed had not received sufficient training in the use of e-procurement systems.

The Taiwan government frequently applies the best-value (BV) tendering method, a multi-criteria evaluation method, to procure projects. However, the selection process of the winner for a BV-based procurement project is generally subjective and thus is easily accused of corruptions. To develop a systematic method to support contractor selection, this study proposes using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to facilitate the criteria evaluations for each bidder during the short-listing stage. The evaluation results of using the DEA are a list of potential BV winners who are then suggested to enter into the final selection stage. Based on three case studies related to service procurement projects, this research finds that the DEA is suitable of assessing the relative efficiencies among bidders when the BV approach is applied. Lessons learned here should be helpful in applying the DEA to aid bid evaluations in other supplier selection problems. © 2016 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.;best-value tendering method, contractor selection, data envelopment analysis, short-listing stage;"Contractors; Data envelopment analysis; Best value; Contractor selection; Evaluation results; Multi-criteria evaluation; Procurement projects; Public procurement; Relative efficiency; Supplier selection; Supply chains";"Aje, I., The impact of contractors' prequalification on construction project delivery in Nigeria (2012) Engineering Construction and Architectural Management, 19 (2), pp. 159-172; Banker, R.D., Estimating most productive scale size using data envelopment analysis (1984) European Journal of Operational Research, 17, pp. 35-44; Charnes, A., Cooper, W.W., Rhodes, E., Measuring the efficiency of decision making units (1978) European Journal of Operational Research, 2, pp. 429-444; Cooper, W.W., Seiford, L.M., Tone, K., (2000) Data Envelopment Analysis: A Comprehensive Text with Model, Applications, References and DEA-solver Software, 528p. , Norwell:Kluwer Academic Publishers; Easton, L., Murphy, D.J., Pearson, J.N., Purchasing performance evaluation: With data envelopment analysis (2002) European Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 8 (3), pp. 123-134; Egemen, M., Mohamed, A.N., Different approaches of clients and consultants to contractors' qualification and selection (2005) Journal of Civil Engineering and Management, 11 (4), pp. 267-276; El-Sawalhi, N., Eaton, D., Rustom, R., Contractor prequalification model: State-of-The-art (2007) International Journal of Project Management, 25 (5), pp. 465-474; Elyamany, A.H., Abdelrahman, M., Zayed, T., Utilizing random performance records in the best value model (2012) Journal of Civil Engineering and Management, 18 (2), pp. 197-208; (2013) Federal Acquisition Regulation, Section 15.304 (C)-(2), , https://www.acquisition.gov/far/current/html/Subpart%2015_3.html, FAR., [cited 18 February 2013]; Farrell, M.J., The measurement of productive efficiency (1957) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, CXX, pp. 253-290; Gattoufi, S., Oral, M., Reisman, A., A taxonomy for data envelopment analysis (2004) Socio-Economic Planning Sciences, 38 (2-3), pp. 141-158; Gransberg, D.D., Ellicott, M.A., Best value contracting criteria, Cost Engineering (1997) Journal of AACE, 39 (6), pp. 31-34; Hatush, Z., Skitmore, M., Criteria for contractor selection (1997) Construction Management and Economics, 15 (1), pp. 19-38; Heidari, M.D., Omid, M., Mohammadi, A., Measuring productive efficiency of horticultural greenhouses in Iran: A data envelopment analysis approach (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (1), pp. 1040-1045; Holt, G.D., Olomolaiye, P.O., Harris, F.C., Factors influencing U.K. Construction clients' choice of contractor (1994) Building and Environment, 29 (2), pp. 241-248; Hsiao, B., Chern, C.C., Chiu, C.R., Performance evaluation with the entropy-based weighted Russell measure in data envelopment analysis (2011) Expert Systems with Applications, 38 (8), pp. 9965-9972; Juan, Y.K., A hybrid approach using data envelopment analysis and case-based reasoning for housing refurbishment contractors selection and performance improvement (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36 (3), pp. 5702-5710; Khodabakhshi, M., Asgharian, M., Gregoriou, G.N., An input-oriented super-efficiency measure in stochastic data envelopment analysis: Evaluating chief executive officers of US public banks and thrifts (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (3), pp. 2092-2097; Lam, K.C., Lam, M.C.K., Wang, D., Efficacy of using support vector machine in a contractor prequalification decision model (2010) Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering, 24 (3), pp. 273-280; Lin, C.C., Wang, W.C., Yu, W.D., Improving AHP for construction with an adaptive AHP approach (A3) (2008) Automation in Construction, 17 (2), pp. 180-187; (2013) 2012 Minnesota Statutes, , https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=16C.02, Minnesota Statutes Chapter 16C.

There are several governmental investments in this area to accomplish the principle of integrity and to achieve more transparency. In Portugal, in the e-government context, the strategy was the adoption of electronic platforms for procurement, as the main reinforcement measure of transparency in public procurement. However, this article, through a exploratory literature review, based on OCDE recommendations and European Union official reports, this paper aims at contributing to the discussion on the use of information and communication technology, specifically electronic platforms, in Portuguese public procurement. While the gains are potentially significant, it should be noted that the implementation of the principle of integrity implies articulated measures of technological and political dimension as well as organizational culture. © 2016 Atas da Conferencia da Associacao Portuguesa de Sistemas de Informacao.

Public procurement is one of the main areas where the government and the private sector interact extensively and is thus open to favoritism and corruption. In Turkey, the new Public Procurement Law, which was drafted with the pull of the EU-IMF-WB nexus, has been amended more than 150 times by the AKP government. In addition to examining favoritism, this book also demonstrates how the legal amendments have increased the use of less competitive procurement methods and discretion in awarding contracts. The results reveal that the AKP majority government has used public procurement as an influential tool both to increase its electoral success, build its own elites and finance politics. The use of public procurement for rent creation and distribution is found to be particularly extensive in the construction and the services sector through the TOKİ projects and the Municipal procurements. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.;;;"Acemoglu, D., Robinson, J., Persistence of power, elites, and institutions American Economic Review, 98, pp. 267-293; Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., Kermani, A., Kwak, J., Mitton, T., (2013) The value of connections in turbulent times: Evidence from the United States, , NBER Working Paper, No: 19701; Agrawal, A., Knoeber, C.R., Do some outside directors play a political role?

Research studies of domestic and foreign authors identified several variables that affect the resulting savings in public procurement. In our contribution we focused on creating models that examine the impact of the number of offers, subcontractor participation and type of procurement procedure for this savings. We analyzed 178 public procurement contracts in the field of transport infrastructure in Slovakia in the years 2010-2015. For detection of relationship between these chosen variables and saving in public procurement were used method as second order polynomial regression and Wilcoxon signed-rank test in the program R.;Public contract, Public procurement, Saving, Second order polynomial regression, Transport infrastructure;;"Antonová, B., Chocholáč, J., Drahotský, I., Analýza závislosti silniční dopravní infrastruktury a přepravních výkonů ve vazbě na HDP české republiky (2016) Scientific Papers of the University of Pardubice, 23 (36), pp. 5-17; Danger, K., Capobianco, A., (2008) Guidelines for Fighting Bid Rigging in Public Procurement, , http://www.oecd.org/competition/cartels/42851044.pdf, [cit. 2016-07-25]; (2000) Measuring the Impact of Public Procurement Policy, First Indicators, , http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/smn/smn20/s20mn_c.htm, [cit. 2016-07-16]; (2008) Price Comparison, Measuring Competition, Savings and their Interlink, , European Commision Pracovný materiál Advisory Commitee on Public Contracts.

A probabilistic ontology provides constructs for representing uncertainty in domain ontologies. While the literature has been growing on formalisms for representing uncertainty in ontologies, there remains little guidance in the knowledge engineering literature for how to design probabilistic ontologies. To address the gap, this paper presents the Uncertainty Modeling Process for Semantic Technology (UMP-ST), a new methodology for modeling probabilistic ontologies. To explain how the methodology works and to verify that it can be applied to different scenarios, this paper describes step-by-step the construction of a proof-of-concept probabilistic ontology. The resulting domain model can be used to support identification of fraud in public procurements in Brazil. While the case study illustrates the development of a probabilistic ontology in the PR-OWL probabilistic ontology language, the methodology is applicable to any ontology formalism that properly integrates uncertainty with domain semantics. © 2016 Carvalho et al.;Bayesian networks, MEBN, Methodology, Modeling, PR-OWL, Semantic technology, Semantic web, UMP-ST, Uncertainty, UP;"Bayesian networks; Birds; Knowledge based systems; Models; Ontology; Semantic Web; MEBN; Methodology; Semantic technologies; UMP-ST; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis";"Adelman, L., (1992) Evaluating decision support and expert systems, , 1st edition.

Complying with procurement standards by law does not necessarily succeeding in implementation of procurement best practices. This paper investigates the moderating impacts of compliance with the GPP on the relationship between the explanatory factors and current Sustainable Public Procurement (SPP) practice in Malaysia, in a comprehensive single framework. Survey questionnaires were administered to 104 government organisations and 177 responses were received from procurement officers. Based on the hierarchical multiple regression analysis, the anticipated outcome of this study is the extent to which the procurement compliance does not guarantee the implementation of SPP practice. The results of this study have provided some explanations regarding the extent of compliance with GPP on the relationship between the explanatory factors and SPP practice.;Compliance, Public procurement, Sustainable public procurement;;"Abu Hassim, A., Stephen, K., Bambang, T., Factors contributing to ethical issues in project management planning: A case study in Malaysia (2010) Proceeding of the 8th International Conference on Construction and Real Estate Management 2010, pp. 1-3. , December.

Method: Traditional methods of research are not able to fully reveal the role of the individual characteristics of criminal risk subjects. The authors looked into socio-perceptual mechanisms of public procurement participants and resorted to the 'red flags' and 'crime hotspots' methods to clarify regularities at the individual level of deviant behavior in order to minimize them and to develop coping strategies Findings: Criminal risks of the national public procurement system have been audited; typical criminal risks arising in all procurement stages both on the part of customers and on the part of other parties have been theoretically diagnosed. The original hypothesis of an exclusively deliberate choice of criminal behavior has been confirmed in part. Improvements: The findings presented in the paper can help increase the detection of crimes in the area of public procurement, enhance the efficiency of investigations and minimize the scope for criminal abuse.";Abuse of office, Abuse of power, Corruption, Criminal risks, Fraud, Illegal business, Misappropriation of budget funds, Misappropriation of state municipal funds, Negligence, Official misconduct;;"Wells, J.T., (2007) Fraud Casebook Lessons from the Bad Side of Business, , John Willey&Sons, Inc: New Jersey; Kovacich, G.L., (2007) Fighting Fraud: How To Establish And Manage An Anti-Fraud Program.1st (edn), , Butterworth-Heinemann; Davies, G., Discrimination and beyond in European Economic and Social Law (2011) Maastricht Journal of European and Comparative Law, 18 (1), pp. 7-28; Chambliss, W.J., Michalowski, R., Kramer, R., (2013) State Crime in the Global Age, , Routledge Publ.: London; Giddens, A., Fate, Risk and Security (1991) In: Modernity and Self-Identity: Self and Society in the Late Modern Age, p. 256. , Stanford University: USA; Luhmann, N., Der Begriff Risiko (1991) In: Soziologie des Risikos, , Walter de Gruyter: Berlin; New York; Beck, U., (1992) Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity (Published in association with Theory, Culture & Society) Paperback, , Sage Publications: London, Newbury Park, New Delhi; Ferwerda, J., Deleanu, I., Unger, B., Corruption in Public Procurement: Finding the Right Indicators (2016) European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research, pp. 1-23. , May; Brantingham, P., Brantingham, P., Theoretical model of crime hot spot generation (1999) Studies on Crime and Crime Prevention, 8 (1), pp. 7-26; Nechayev, A.D., Tishchenko, E.V., Criminal law risks in the sphere of discharging the obligations by the governmental and municipal contract parties (2013) Terra Economicus, 11 (2-3), pp. 176-183; Risk Management in Public Procurement Process.

From a public sector perspective, e-procurement can be termed as a comprehensive process in which governments use IT systems to establish agreements for the acquisitions of goods and services. There have been several academic studies on the benefits, organisational performance and critical success factors of the adoption and implementation of e-procurement in public sector organisations. One of the perceived benefits of e-procurement adoption is its impact on controlling public sector corruption. Most studies have been based on creating efficiencies in the public procurement of developed countries while studies on developing countries appeared neglected. There is evidence in the body of literature that corruption in the public sector has a negative effect on the development of countries. Studies estimate that corruption can add as much as 50% to the cost of public procurement projects. In developing countries, over the years, there has been increasing reports of corruption in public procurement where participants engage in the practice of offering, giving, receiving or soliciting, directly or indirectly, anything of value to influence improperly the actions of another party. Reports suggests that over $2 trillion is lost to public procurement corruption on a yearly basis. This study empirically investigates the impact of e-procurement on curbing public sector corruption in developing countries. Using primary data gathered by a questionnaire survey of the public sector in Nigeria, a cross sectional analysis and factor analysis will be conducted. Preliminary survey results show that most of the participants agree that the adoption, implementation and utilisation of e-Procurement has a positive relationship on the control of and reduction in public procurement corruption. Initial results also indicate that the two most important factors were the reduction of corruption in the procurement process and the implementation of e-procurement helps to improve transparency in the procurement process. This study adds to the body of literature relating to public sector, developing countries, public procurement and corruption. On a policy and practitioner level, the paper furthers our understanding of how e-procurement curbs corruption in public procurement and expounds on the main processes that are pertinent for the reduction of corrupt practices in public sector organisations. © The Authors, 2016.;Developing country study, E-procurement, Public corruption, Public sector;"Developing countries; Electronic data interchange; Government data processing; Purchasing; Surveys; Critical success factor; Cross sectional analysis; e-Procurement; Electronic procurement; Organisational performance; Public corruption; Public sector; Questionnaire surveys; Crime";"Abu-ElSamen, A., Chakraborty, G., Warren, D., A process-based analysis of e-procurement adoption (2010) Journal of Internet Commerce, 9 (3-4), pp. 243-259; Adebayo, V., Examining the implantation of sustainability into state procurement decision models: an experiential overview of the Nigerian public sector (2015), London, Proceedings from the World Congress on Sustainable Technologies, Sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (IEEE); Aman, A., Kasimin, H., E-procurement implementation: a case of Malaysia government (2011) Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy, 5 (4), pp. 330-341; Baily, P., Procurement principles and management (2008), s.l.: Pearson Education; Bof, Previtali, P., National models of public (e)-procurement in Europe (2010) Journal of e-Government Studies and Best Practices, 2010, pp. 1-14. , 315295; Budg, I.T., Nigeria Budget data (2015), www.yourbudgit.com/data/, Accessed 2 March 2015; Cabras, I., Use of E-procurement in Local Authorities' Purchasing and Its Effects on Local Economies: Evidence from Cumbria, UK (2010) European Planning Studies, 18 (7), pp. 1133-1151; Carayannis, E., Popescu, D., Profiling a methodology for economic growth and convergence: learning from the EU e-procurement experience for central and eastern European countries (2005) Technovation, 25 (1), pp. 1-14; E-Procurement (2007), https://www.cips.org/en-GB/Knowledge/Procurement-topics-andskills/eCommerce---systems/E-sourcing--E-procurement-systems-P2P/eProcurement/, Accessed 24 February 2014; Costa, A., Arantes, A., Tavares, L., Evidence of the impacts of public e-procurement: The Portuguese experience (2013) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 19 (4), pp. 238-246; Croom, S., The impact of web-based procurement on the management of operating resources supply (2000) Journal of Supply Chain Management, 36 (1), p. 4; Croom, S., Brandon-Jones, A., Impact of e-procurement: experiences from implementation in the UK public sector (2007) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 13 (4), pp. 294-303; De Boer, L., Harink, J., Heijboer, G., A conceptual model for assessing the impact of electronic procurement (2002) European Journal of Purchasing & Supply Management, 8 (1), pp. 25-33; EFCC: Our Mission Statement (2014), http://efccnigeria.org/efcc/, Accessed 18 June 2015; Illicit Financial Flows from Developing Countries: 2004-2013 (2015), http://www.gfintegrity.org/report/illicit-financial-flows-from-developing-countries-2004-2013/, Accessed 31 December 2015; Grødeland, Å., Aasland, A., Fighting corruption in public procurement in post-communist states: Obstacles and solutions (2011) Communist and Post-Communist Studies, 44 (1), pp. 17-32; Gunasekaran, A., Ngai, E., Adoption of e-procurement in Hong Kong: an empirical research (2008) International Journal of Production Economics, 113 (1), pp. 159-175; Hardy, C., Williams, S., E-government policy and practice: A theoretical and empirical exploration of public e-procurement (2008) Government Information Quarterly, 25 (2), pp. 155-180; Henriksen, H., Mahnke, V., E-procurement adoption in the Danish public sector: The influence of economic and political rationality (2005) Scandinavian Journal of Information Systems, 17 (2), p. 2; Iqbal, S., Seo, J., E-Governance as an anti-corruption tool: Korean Cases (2008) Journal of Korean; Kaliannan, M., Awang, H., Adoption and use of e-government services: a case study on e-procurement in Malaysia (2010) WSEAS Transactions on Business and Economics, 7 (1), pp. 1-10; Law Leung, R., Buhalis, D., Information Technology Applications in Hospitality and Tourism: A Review of Publications from 2005 to 2007 (2014) Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, pp. 1-36; MacManus, S., Understanding the incremental nature of e-procurement implementation at the state and local levels (2002) Journal of Public Procurement, 2 (1), pp. 5-28; Mahmood, S., Public procurement and corruption in Bangladesh.

White-collar criminals in public procurement corruption are probably no exception. Public procurement appears particularly vulnerable to corruption despite the multitude of policies and procedures that most public organisations have in place to ensure proper stewardship of public funds. While these mechanisms are designed to control and make transparent the procurement process, corruption has been inherent in public procurement since governments first began buying goods and services. This article presents the topics of white-collar crime, public procurement corruption, and detection by whistleblowers. Based on a sample of 390 convicted white-collar criminals in Norway from 2009 to 2014, this article explores sources of detection with an emphasis on whistleblowing. It seems that whistleblowers are the single most important source of detection. Based on conflict theory, there is a need to strengthen the role of whistleblowers and prevent them from revenge and retaliation. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.;Crime detection, Procurement, Public corruption, Social conflict theory, Whistleblowing;;"Abdulai, A.G., Political will in combating corruption in developing and transition economies: A comparative study of Singapore, Hong Kong and Ghana (2009) Journal of Financial Crime, 16 (4), pp. 387-417; Atwater, K., Whistle Blowers Enforce Procurement Ethics, 2006. , http://americancityandcounty.com/mag/whistle-blowersenforce-procurement-ethics, American City & County, published 23 October [online] (accessed 10 February 2015); Bendiktsson, M.O., The Deviant Organization and the Bad Apple CEO: Ideology and accountability in media coverage of corporate scandals (2010) Social Forces, 88 (5), pp. 2189-2216; Benson, M.L., Simpson, S.S., (2014) Understanding White-Collar Crime - An Opportunity Perspective, , Routledge, New York, NY; Bertolini, M., Bevilacqua, M., Ciarapica, E., Postacchini, L., Business process reengineering of drugs storage and distribution: A case study (2015) International Journal of Procurement Management, 8 (1-2), pp. 44-65; Bjørkelo, B., Matthiesen, S.B., Preventing and dealing with retaliation against whistleblowers (2011) Whistleblowing and Democratic Values, , in Lewis, D. and Vandekerckhove, W.

Five concentration ratios and five parameters of contracts are calculated for each of five chosen areas of public tenders in 2007 and 2011. After this task, the correlation analysis between concentration ratios and parameters of contracts is done for finding out mutual relation between these two variables. Correlation analysis is then compared with four created hypotheses about the relationship between market concentration and parameters of public procurement The results of the analysis are surprising, because in most cases, the stated hypotheses were rejected, meaning that the correlations between the parameters of public procurement and market concentration were different than this study predicted based on economic theory. The possible reasons for this result, discussed in the article, are corruption and also poor quality of data from Information system of public procurement administered by the Ministry for Regional Development of Czech Republic.;Analysis, Concentration ratios, Correlation, Parameters of contracts, Public tenders;;"Amir, R., (2000) Market Structure, Scale Economies, and Industryperformance, , WZB Discussion Paper No. FS IV 00-08; Bajari, P., Comparing competition and collusion in procurement auctions: A numerical approach (2001) Economic Theory, 18 (1), pp. 187-205; Haaf, K., Bikker, J.A., (2000) Measures of Competition and Concentration in Banking Industry: A Review of the Literature., , http://www.dnb.nl/en/binaries/ot027_tcm47-146045.pdf, [Online].

The research is based on empirical evidence collected by surveying a large sample of companies. It investigates how businesses as actors in the public procurement tenders evaluate the system and what their perceived and experienced views are on the various components of public procurement. The baseline model borrows from the literature by including companies’ characteristics in terms of company size and sector of business operations. Furthermore, it assumes that there are significant differences in attitudes and ratings among companies that have participated in public procurement as direct suppliers compared to companies that have been indirectly involved as subcontractors. The business opinion on the public procurement system procedures and regulations has been assessed as well, providing insights into the business perceptions on main public procurement principles: accountability, effectiveness, value for money, integrity and achieving the EU standards. Special attention has been dedicated to the assessment of corruption risks in public procurement. The evidence for Croatia reveals that in spite of the EU standards introduced there are still, at least from the point of view of companies, irregularities and lack of trust in the national public procurement system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.;;;"Ateljević, J., Budak, J., Corruption and public procurement: Example from Croatia (2010) Journal of Balkan and Near Eastern Studies, 12 (4), pp. 375-397; Bovis, C.H., (2012) EU public procurement law, , (2nd ed.).

Using a large dataset on procurements of AI-92 gasoline in Russia in 2011, we show that price difference between repeated and one-time contracts can be explained by the type of procurement procedures. Less transparent procedures (single-sourcing and requests for quotations) are more suitable for corrupt collusion. This might explain relative price increase in this case. On the contrary, the prices of repeated contracts were lower compared to one-time procurement in the case of more transparent e-auctions. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.;Corruption, E-auction, Public procurement, Relational contracting, Repeated contracts;;"Avdasheva, S., Goreyko, N., Pittman, R., Collective dominance and its abuse under the competition law of the Russian Federation (2012) World Competition, 35 (2), pp. 249-272; Calzolari, G., Spagnolo, G., (2008) Relational Procurement, , February, Mimeo; Den Butter, F.A.G., The transaction management perspective on procurement in the era of globalisation (2012) International Journal of Procurement Management (IJPM), 5 (2), pp. 123-139; Gulati, R., Does familiarity breed trust? the implications of repeated ties for contractual choice in alliances (1995) The Academy of Management Journal, 38 (1), pp. 85-112; Held, C.M., (2012) Evaluation of Strategies for Repeat Procurement, A Thesis Presented to the Academic Faculty in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Doctor of Philosophy in the College of Management, , Georgia Institute of Technology, May 2012; Klotz, D.E., Chatterjee, K., Dual sourcing in repeated procurement competition (1995) Management Science, August, 41 (8), pp. 1317-1327; Laffont, J., Tirole, J., Auction design and favoritism (1991) International Journal of Industrial Organization, 9 (1), pp. 9-42; Lambsdorff, J.G., (2007) Corrupt Relational Contracting, pp. 209-224. , The Institutional Economics of Corruption and Reform: Theory, Evidence and Policy, Chap. 9, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; Lewis, M.A., Roehrich, J.K., Contracts, relationships and integration: Towards a model of the procurement of complex performance (2009) International Journal of Procurement Management (IJPM), 2 (2), pp. 125-142; Lyon, T.P., Does dual sourcing lower procurement costs?

Complete contracts entail state-contingent clauses that compensate the contractor for shocks unrelated to his own effort. By improving insurance, those contracts reduce the agency cost of moral hazard. When the contractor has private information on revenues shocks, verifying messages on shocks realizations is costly. Incomplete contracts do not specify state-contingent clauses, thereby saving on verifiability costs. This makes incomplete contracts attractive even though they entail greater agency costs. Because of private information on contracting costs, a public official may have discretion to choose whether to procure under a complete or an incomplete contract. When the public official is corrupt, such delegation results in incomplete contracts being chosen too often. Empirical predictions on the use of incomplete contracts and policy implications on the benefits of standardized contracts are discussed. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.;Corruption, Incomplete contracts, Moral hazard, Principalagentsupervisor model, Publicprivate partnerships, Risk allocation;"Contractors; Costs; Crime; Economics; Public policy; Risk management; Corruption; Incomplete contracts; Moral hazard; Public private partnerships; Risk allocation; Contracts";"Aghion, P., Hermalin, B., Legal restrictions on private contracts can enhance efficiency (1990) J.

A large-scale microeconomic database, including all public procurement operations over a 4-year period in Paraguay, amounting annually to approximately 6% of the country's GDP, is then used to corroborate these predictions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;Corruption, Development, Procurement, Rent-seeking;"corruption; entrepreneur; Gross Domestic Product; microeconomics; prediction; rent seeking; Paraguay";"Agrawal, A., Knoeber, C., Do some outside directors play a political role?

The resulting model is a two-dimensional, continuous and piecewise smooth dynamic system which describes the evolution of the capital per capita and that of the corruption level. We prove that the model admits multiple equilibria: their stability and the structure of their basins is studied. We also present numerical simulations for economic meaningful parameter values, useful to explain the role of parameters in the long–run path of the model. Our study aims at demonstrating that stable equilibria with positive corruption may exist (according to empirical evidence), even though the State may reduce corruption by increasing the wage of the bureaucrat or by increasing the amount of tax revenues used to monitor corruption. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.;Corruption, Discrete dynamics, Growth, Multiple equilibria, Procurement, Stability;;"Abed, G.T., Gupta, S., (2002) Governance, Corruption, and Economic Performance, , (eds), International Monetary Fund, Washington; Abraham, R., Gardini, L., Mira, C., (1997) Chaos in Discrete Dynamical Systems (A Visual Introduction in Two Dimensions), , Springer, New York; Abramo, C.W., Prevention and Detection in Bribery-Affected Public Procurement (2003) Transparencia Brasil Working Paper (September); Bajari, P., Tadelis, S., Incentive versus transaction costs: a theory of procurement contracts (2001) Rand J.

The maturity model is used to benchmark an organization’s contract management process maturity and to use the assessment results to develop a road map for implementing process improvement as well as knowledge-sharing initiatives. Design/methodology/approach – This is survey-based research on benchmarking contract management processes in the US Navy. A web-based assessment tool was deployed to US Navy contracting officers located at aeronautical systems, sea systems, and logistics support contracting agencies. The assessment tool consists of survey items related to the use of contracting best practices. The survey responses are then used to calculate the agency’s contract management process maturity level. Findings – The benchmarking results reflected higher maturity levels in the pre-award contracting processes (Procurement Planning, Solicitation Planning, and Source Selection), while lower maturity levels were reflected in the post-award contracting processes (Contract Administration and Contract Closeout). The research findings related to process capability enablers also reflected higher mean scores for the pre-award processes and lower mean scores for the post-award processes. These maturity levels and process capability enabler scores reflect the extent of the implementation of contracting best practices within the Navy contracting agencies. Research limitations/implications – This research uses a purposeful sampling approach designed to acquire data on organizational contract management processes. The assessment survey was administered only to qualified Navy contracting officers. The Navy contracting agencies are responsible for procuring billions of dollars in supplies and services in support of the Navy mission. Although the assessed contracting agencies procure different types of systems, supplies, and services, the contract management processes used are common to all Navy, Army, Air Force, and other US federal government agencies. The conclusions based on the analysis of these benchmarking assessments may be applicable to Department of Defense (DoD) and other government agencies. Practical implications – The findings suggest that benchmarking can be effective in measuring and improving contracting process capability within the Navy. Benchmarking contracting processes can have far-reaching effects throughout the DoD. The Under Secretary of Defense’s has mandated initiatives related to improving both pre- and post-award contracting processes. The use of these benchmarking assessments can be instrumental in tracking the achievements of these process improvement initiatives. Additionally, the US Congress is leading the push for auditability in procurement operations. By benchmarking and improving its contracting processes, the DoD will be winning the battle toward integrity, accountability, and transparency of its financial operations. Social implications – Benchmarking contracting processes can also have far-reaching effects in society. Many governments are focussing on integrity, accountability, and transparency in public procurement. International organizations such as Transparency International (TI) have identified process capability and process integrity as key for reducing the potential for procurement-related fraud, waste, and abuse. Additionally, NATO member countries and partner nations are focussing on the value of assessing and improving procurement processes for strengthening transparency and accountability. The value of benchmarking and improving contracting processes is gaining much attention in global public procurement agencies as they strive for accountability, integrity, and transparency in their governance processes. Originality/value – There are multiple reports on deficiencies in DoD’s contract management processes, identifying poor contract planning, and Contract Administration as just some of the critically deficient areas. In response, the DoD is increasing its emphasis on developing its workforce competence through education initiatives. However, very little attention is being paid to benchmarking contract management processes. This research reflects the value of benchmarking DoD’s contract management process maturity and using the results for implementing process improvement initiatives. Using process benchmarking data, agencies can identify process improvement initiatives that will ensure government tax dollars are spent in the most effective and efficient ways. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Benchmarking, Contract management, Maturity model, Performance measurement, Process maturity, Procurement;;"Ahern, D.M., Clouse, A., Turner, R., (2001) CMMI, Distilled, , andAddison-Wesley, Boston, MA:; Amirkhanyan, A.A., What is the effect of performance measurement on perceived accountability effectiveness in state and local government contracts?

Common laws and regulations across regions, nations and continents potentially allow for the further opening of markets and ventures to newcomers and new ideas to satisfy public demand. This book collects original contributions, from both economists and lawyers, related to the new European Union Directives just approved in 2014 by the EU Parliament. Uniquely, this book combines juridical and technical expertise so as to find a common terrain and language to debate the specific issues that a Public Administration in need of advancing and modernizing has to face. This format features, for each section, an introductory exchange between two experts of different disciplines, made of a series of sequential interactions between an economist and a lawyer that write and follow-up on one another. This is to enrich the liveliness of the debate and improve the mutual understanding between the two professions. There are four sections characterized in this book: supporting social considerations via public procurement; green public procurement; innovation through innovative partnerships; and Lots-the Economic and Legal Challenges of Centralized Procurement. This book will be of interest to policy-makers, practitioners working in the field of EU public procurement as well as academics. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Gustavo Piga and Tunde Tatrai.

Essentially these dilemmas have placed public procurement at the forefront of government reform efforts. The current study delineates the nature of five dilemmas that purchasing practitioners face, and the implications of these dilemmas for purchasing in the public sphere are explored. Given the complexity of these dilemmas, procurement professionals will be continually called upon to balance these inherent tensions with little guidance from policymakers or elected officials. © 2015 by PrAcademics Press.";;;"Aberbach, J.D., Rockman, B.A., Mandates or Mandarins?

It is noted that the specific role of auditing has strengthened over recent years, while the other, essentially technical controls that were traditionally applied over the long process of developing public works contracts, have since been reduced. The author feels that this current trend for greater auditing and reduced technical control throughout the entire process will lead to a less efficient use of public funds. The public function of controlling public investment in transport and water infrastructure should be made with respect to all infrastructure, without exception. This control should be exercised throughout the entire development process and throughout all its stages (planning, design, construction and operation), and competent engineers, selected on merit and ability, should verify due compliance with the contract terms established in the specifications and in the project documents. Project or work management requires specific engineering training and a capacity to take decisions on the go to resolve both foreseeable and unforeseen problems that may arise when working on site. These problems may v/eli arise as a result of the many variables concerning the terrain or on account of time constraints or when soil specimens selected with professional criteria to investigate the ground do not prove sufficiently representative.;;"Budget control; Compliance control; Investments; Public administration; Budgetary controls; Competent Engineers; Development process; Engineering training; Public investments; Public procurement; State administration; Water infrastructure; Process control";;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84929448733

Conventional wisdom holds that increased economic marketization reduces corruption. China, however, provides evidence to the contrary; corruption has grown as its market-oriented reforms progress. This paradoxical co-development of the market and corruption begs the intriguing questions of how corruption has survived marketization and what explains the failure of government regulation. Extending the conceptual framework of institutional theory about formal and informal rules, and using public procurement in China as an example, this article shows that formal tendering rules and regulations may be modified, circumvented, or replaced by informal ones which facilitate corruption. The article identifies four corruption schemes through which procurement actors may distort competition processes and mechanisms under the guise of formal rules. Consequently, public procurement in China displays the structural outlook of market competition, but not its essential substance. © 2014 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.";China, Corruption, Informal rules, Market competition, Public procurement;;"Ades, A., Di Tella, R., National Champions and Corruption: Some Unpleasant Interventionist Arithmetic (1997) Economic Journal, 107, pp. 1023-1042; Ades, A., Di Tella, R., Rents, Competition, and Corruption (1999) American Economic Review, 89, pp. 982-993; Batory, A., Why Do Anti-corruption Laws Fail in Central Eastern Europe?

Design/methodology/approach – This paper discusses public sector corruption in Japan at an institutional level through a study of its features and current status. It then analyzes and evaluates the effectiveness of corruption prevention measures and the public perceptions of these measures. The paper concludes with a discussion on whether such measures can be adopted by other countries. Findings – Recent preventive measures in Japan are effective in decreasing corruption opportunities, but not in enhancing the public trust of the government. Major findings are: first, Japan is the only Asian country without a dedicated anti-corruption agency (ACA); second, there is more emphasis on corruption prevention in the anti-corruption measures; third, the government is concerned with initiating measures to prevent the further erosion of public trust when corruption occurs; fourth, while preventive measures such as public disclosure and whistle-blower protection acts are in place, public awareness of their existence is still lacking and the usage of these systems is limited; fifth, more efforts are placed on prevention through the promotion of government transparency and accountability and public sector ethics education rather than penalizing the corrupt offenders; and sixth, though efforts to minimize amakudari practices are made, lack of political will and its sustainability prevents further reform. Originality/value – This paper will be useful for scholars, policy-makers, and anti-corruption practitioners interested in learning how Japanese government practices prevent corruption. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";Amakudari, Disclosure of public information, Public procurement, Public sector ethics, Public trust, Whistle-blower protection;;"www.jftc.go.jp/en/legislation_gls/aepibr.files/aepibr.pdf, Act on Elimination Prevention of Involvement in Bid Rigging, etc. Punishments for Acts by Employees that Harm Fairness of Bidding, etc. (Act 101 of 2002) (English translation), :;

This has had serious policy implications for public procurement policy across countries because of its implications for the achievement of the objectives defined at the inception of PPP road contracts. This paper assesses the renegotiation of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects in order to identify the issues involved in renegotiation and its outcomes. Data were collected through a literature review of selected studies on PPP infrastructure projects on a sectoral basis with particular emphasis on Latin America, Portugal and Spain. It was revealed that a high proportion of PPP contracts in the transport sector are renegotiated: Indeed, in the transport sector, more PPP road projects are renegotiated than other forms of transport projects. The main factors surrounding the renegotiation of road contracts are: lack of an adequate contract design, frequent opportunistic behaviour on the part of both public and private partners during the implementation of PPP road projects, changes in the conditions affecting revenue and costs beyond the reasonable assumptions accounted for in the original contract, corruption, and political and economic instability, all of which in most instances reduce the chance of the public partner achieving its objective of value for money (VfM). The paper concludes with a discussion of the need to develop a framework for integrating considerations of value for money into the renegotiation process of PPP road contracts.;Public-private partnership (PPP), Renegotiation, Road contracts, Transport sector, Value for money (VfM);"Highway planning; Project management; Public policy; Roads and streets; Transportation; Public private partnerships; Renegotiation; Road contracts; Transport sectors; Value for monies; Highway administration";"Acerete, J.B., Shaoul Stafford J, A., Stapleton, P., The cost of using private finance for roads in Spain and the UK (2010) Australian Journal of Public Administration, 69 (1), pp. S48-S60; Akintoye, A., Chinyio, E., Private finance initiative in the healthcare sector: Trends and risk assessment (2005) Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management, 12 (6), pp. 601-616; Baeza, M.D.L.A., Vassallo, J.M., Private concession contracts for toll roads in Spain: Analysis and recommendations (2010) Public Money and Management, 30 (5), pp. 299-304; Bain, R., Public sector comparators for UK pfi roads: Inside the black box (2010) Transportation, 37 (3), pp. 447-471; Bi, X., Wang, H., The control of moral hazard in ppp project renegotiation, industrial engineering and engineering management (ie&em) (2011) 2011 IEEE 18th International Conference on 2011, pp. 232-236. , IEEE; Bitran, E., Nieto-Parra, S., Robledo, J.S., (2013) Opening the Black Box of Contract Renegotiations: An Analysis of Road Concessions in Chile, Colombia and Peru.

One of factors that strongly influence the unfavourable rating in these areas is a situation on the public procurement market. The presented paper aims by use of quantitative analysis to determine the extent to which are the level of corruption and public sector efficiency linked to selected indicators dealing with the situation on the public procurement market. The paper deals with two main topics. Firstly we discuss the procurement market from the macro-perspective. Secondly we have prepared two econometric models, which are analysing the relationship between level of corruption/efficiency of the public sector and selected indicators of the situation on the public procurement market (e.g. average number of bids, intensity of the competitive effect).

This study explores the public procurement reform process in Turkey with reference to the implementation of governance as part of an ongoing neoliberal discourse and practice. Turkey’s public procurement system was reformed in 2002 in line with governance principles of transparency, anti-corruption, securing competition and by establishing an independent regulatory institution. A decade after this reform, our analysis shows that political will, economic forces in the procurement market and problems in the institutional-organizational setting are factors that play a role in the relapses from governance ideals and practices. Points for practitioners: Reforms aimed at achieving good governance in public procurements are hard to sustain. The specific institutional traditions of local contexts, interventions of political authorities and powerful economic interests play an important role in the success of reforms. Persistent ad hoc modifications of public procurement laws erode the regulatory scope, change the composition and political autonomy of board membership, and undermine the principles of transparency, accountability and competitiveness. There is a need to actively ensure sustainability of governance principles through strong defense mechanisms which should be institutionalized within local social dynamics. © The Author(s) 2015.;Developing countries, Good governance, Public procurement, Public sector reform, Turkey;"governance approach; local government; political reform; public administration; public sector; reform process; Turkey";"Alyanak, S., The public procurement system of Turkey in comparison to European Community procurement legislation (2007) Public Contract Law Journal, 36, pp. 203-228; Bedirhanoğlu, P., The neoliberal discourse on corruption as a means of consent building: Reflections from post-crisis Turkey (2007) Third World Quarterly, 28 (8), pp. 1239-1254; Büber, B., Yeni Bir Ç atışma Alanı: Kamu Alımları [A new area of conflict: Public procurements] (2008) Phd Thesis, , Ankara University, Turkey; Coxson, S.L., Assessment of Armenian local government corruption potential (2009) Public Administration and Development, 29, pp. 193-203; Çulha-Zabcı, F., (2002) Dünya Bankası’nın Küresel Pazar için Yeni Stratejisi: Yönetişim, 57 (3), pp. 151-179. , [The new strategy of the World Bank for the global market: Governance].

The purpose of this article is to examine the problems of drug provision and a development of measures to improve accessibility of medicines for patients with CVD in the Republic of Dagestan. The analysis of indicators of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases in the Republic of Dagestan allowed the author to conclude that activities implemented in the framework of socially significant target program ""Improving medical care for patients with vascular diseases in the Republic of Dagestan for 2012-2014 years"", have led to reduce mortality from circulatory diseases in the population of the region. At the same time, the average duration of life after the detection of CHD remains low, which suggests the lack of effectiveness of the system of rendering medical aid to patients with CVD. A mandatory component of the health system, a member of the program of state guarantees is the medication provision of the population. The study of the level and quality of provision of medicines of patients in the Republic of Dagestan gives the basis to speak about the low level of availability of essential drugs for patients with the most severe pathology of CVD. In the framework of this article were identified the main systemic problems of drug supply of the population with circulatory diseases in the Republic of Dagestan, demanding the immediate solution. These include: lack of financial security TPSG, a lack of effective system of public procurement of medicines, low availability of medications for CVD patients living in rural areas.";Availability of drugs, Cardiovascular disease (CVD), Diseases of the circulatory system (DCS), Drug supply, Medications (drugs), Medicines, Quality of medical care, The territorial program of state guarantees (TPSG);"essential drug; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; disease duration; health care system; health insurance; human; medical assistant; morbidity; rural area; Russian Federation";"Nichols, M., Townsend, N., Scarborough, P., Rayner, M., Cardiovascular disease in Europe 2014: Epidemiological update (2014) European Heart Journal, pp. 1-10. , August; Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Canberra, (2010) Cardiovascular Disease Mortality.

The necessity of the harmonisation of public and private interests in the public service is based on the following features: civil service reliability and implementation of its purpose in order to guarantee the public interest; clear, binding standards of conduct applicable to all persons employed in the public service, regardless of their duties and career development nature; aim to prevent the emergence and spread of corruption in the public service; constitutional requirements for the implementation of public service. The article reveals that there are two key elements of a conflict of interest: 1) official duties that ensure the implementation of a public interest; 2) private interest which may negatively affect the performance of official duties. It follows that if a conflict of interest in the public service is not resolved or addressed properly, sooner or later it turns into corruption, and cause significant damage to the state itself. It is therefore very important timely identification, removal and management of the conflict of interest.";Civil service, Conflict of interest, Private interests, Public interests, Public procurement, Public service, Sustainable development;;"Administraciniu bylu del tarnybiniu gincu nagrinejimo teismuose praktikos apibendrinimas, aprobuotas Lietuvos vyriausiojo administracinio teismo teiseju 2006 m. liepos 3 d.

In this empirical study, we developed a web-based survey designed to assess the DoD procurement workforce's knowledge of procurement internal controls as well as their perceptions of organisational internal controls. Based on our findings, we concluded that agencies may be lacking auditability in their organisations, and we provided recommendations to DoD on improving procurement internal controls to help reduce its vulnerability to procurement fraud as well as ensure auditability in their organisations. As defence organisations, as well as international public procurement agencies, continue to strive for accountability, integrity, and transparency in their procurement operations, auditability will continue to increase in importance.

Abas Azmi K.S., Abdul Rahman A.A.L.;"56819008200;56818789600;";E-Procurement: A tool to mitigate public procurement fraud in Malaysia?;2015;Proceedings of the European Conference on e-Government, ECEG;2015-January;;;361;368;;4;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84940824538&partnerID=40&md5=d91be2d3b8181533e5f6f91d8644f42d;The major aim of this paper is to explore and analyse the views of Malaysian public officials on how e-Procurement helps mitigate procurement fraud. Inevitably, government activities have an intertwined relationship with the private sector manifested in the implementation of activities such as acquisition of works, supplies and services. While it is fully legitimate for private enterprises to bid for public works, in many cases there is inappropriate granting of public money to non-qualifying private business in a fraudulent manner. Concerns about public procurement fraud in Malaysia have been of practical significance for massive public spending and great deficiencies among various government departments. The visibilities of fraud losses in the public sector have undermined the delivery of public services. Decrease of fraud can improve the country's growth in terms of infrastructure, by providing facilities to improve healthcare and education, to combat poverty, and to fund security and defence. The prevalence of public procurement fraud has eroded public confidence of political and economic institutions. The implementation of E-Government has transformed the public service into a dynamic and diverse environment for government activities. Electronic Procurement (e-Procurement) can be used as a tool to mitigate fraudulent activities in public organisations. In other words, e-Procurement is one way of mitigating public procurement fraud in Malaysia by ensuring accountability, transparency and the achievement of best value for money contracts. In this study, the oral history technique via in-depth interviews and documentary analysis using a political economy approach are employed. We examine how e-Procurement is infused with power relations of dynamic institutions, various vested interests and publicprivate interactions. This study shows how e-Procurement helps to alleviate fraudulent activities in the Malaysian public procurement and it has a number of practical implementations and contributions. The experience and views on e- Procurement by Malaysian public officials can facilitate policy makers, enforcement agencies and researchers in understanding how to mitigate public procurement fraud using an automated and online environment. However, this study also concludes that e-Procurement is just a 'tool' to moderate public procurement fraud, not the solution to this problem. © The Authors, 2015.;E-Procurement, Fraud, Malaysia, Public procurement, Public-private organisations;"Crime; Economics; Electronic data interchange; Government data processing; Public policy; Purchasing; Societies and institutions; e-Procurement; Fraud; Malaysia; Public procurement; Public-private; Supply chains";"Abrams, L., (2010) Oral history theory, , Abingdon, Routledge; Alaweti, M.F.A.N., Faryadi, Q., The transparency of public bidding and contracting using e-procurement in malaysia smpps (2013) International Conference on Social Science Research, ICSSR 2013, , WorldConferences.net, (Year) Published Malaysia; Amaral, M., Public vs private management of public utilities - The case of urban public transport in Europe (2008) Research in Transportation Economics, 22, pp. 85-90; Auriol, E., Blanc, A., Capture and corruption in public utilities: The cases of water and electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa (2009) Utilities Policy, 17, pp. 203-216; Bakre, O.M., (2010) Privatisation and the struggle for control of capital in Nigeria, pp. 8-11. , (Year), Published; Barbieri, P., Zanoni, A., THE E-PROCUREMENT EXPERIENCE IN ITALIAN UNIVERSITIES (2005) Journal of Public Procurement, 5, pp. 323-343; Bertot, J.C., Jaeger, P.T., Grimes, J.M., Using ICTs to create a culture of transparency: E-government and social media as openness and anti-corruption tools for societies (2010) Government Information Quarterly, 27, pp. 264-271; Bjorvatn, K., Søreide, T., Corruption and privatization (2005) European Journal of Political Economy, 21, pp. 903-914; Boyer, K.K., Hallowell, R., Roth, A.V., E-services: operating strategy-a case study and a method for analyzing operational benefits (2002) Journal of Operations Management, 20, pp. 175-188; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, pp. 77-101; Caulfield, T.O.M., THE Anatomy OF PROCUREMENT FRAUD (2014) Contract Management, 54, pp. 52-55; Christopoulos, D.C., Towards representative expert surveys: Legitimizing the collection of expert data (2009) Eurostat Conference for New Techniques and Technologies for Statistics, , Brussels, Belgium; Dastidar, K.G., Mukherjee, D., Corruption in delegated public procurement auctions (2014) European Journal of Political Economy, 35, pp. 122-127; Davila, A., Gupta, M., Palmer, R., Moving Procurement Systems to the Internet:: the Adoption and Use of E-Procurement Technology Models (2003) European Management Journal, 21, pp. 11-23; de Ruyter, K., Wetzels, M., Kleijnen, M., Customer adoption of e-service: an experimental study (2001) International Journal of Service Industry Management, 12, pp. 184-207; Della Porta, D., Vannucci, A., Corruption and anti-corruption: The political defeat of 'Clean Hands' in Italy (2007) West European Politics, 30, pp. 830-853; Demski, J.S., Magee, R.P., A Perspective on Accounting for Defense Contracts (1992) Accounting Review, 67, pp. 732-740; Dorussen, H., Lenz, H., Blavoukos, S., Assessing the Reliability and Validity of Expert Interviews (2005) European Union Politics, 6, pp. 315-337; Easterby-Smith, M., Thorpe, R., Lowe, A., (1991) Management research: an introduction, , London, Sage; Goodman, L.A., Snowball Sampling (1961) The Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 32, pp. 148-170; Guest, G., MacQueen, K.M., Namey, E.E., (2012) Applied thematic analysis, , Los Angeles; Haron, R., Mohamed, N., Omar, N., Jomitin, B., Combating fraud in public procurement: A never ending story (2013) The 5th International Conference on Financial Criminology (ICFC) 2013; Global Trends in Financial Crimes in the New Economies Malaysia: Accounting Research Institute (ARI); Heggstad, K., Isaksen, J., Frøystad, M., (2010) The Basics of Integrity in Procurement, , A Guidebook.

Considering the regulations governing relations in this sphere of activity, the author evaluates the effectiveness of the federal contract system formed on the basis of these regulations. Analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the legal framework of using the state order institution in modern Russia and in a number of foreign countries, the author proves the proposals to improve the system of public procurement in order to stimulate innovation at the most rational use of budgetary funds and prevent corruption. Particular attention is paid to the study of the quality of legal provisions of the Federal Law of 05.04.2013 No. 44-FZ and to justifying the need for further improvement of the federal contract system.

While many good legislation and institutional frameworks have been set in place to fight corruption in Uganda; the results remain disappointing. The recent procurement reforms in Uganda (from 2003 to date) are yet to yield substantive results to this end. In this paper we advocate for the use of citizen-driven approaches (CDAs) as a strategy for addressing the public procurement corruption malaise in Uganda's local governments. Drawing from empirical findings from over 1,000 randomly sampled respondents in the four regions of Uganda, the paper also examines the contradictions associated CDA and suggestions on what governments ought to do if they are to achieve benefits from this approach. We propose social accountability (SAc), a process of constructive engagement between citizens and government in order to improve performance in the use of public resources.

While there is research evidence to suggest the incidence of corruption in public procurement in Africa, the article identifies deeper root causes. The study investigates some traditional drivers of corruption in public procurement in Africa. The constant comparative analytic approach is used to analyse interview data. Our findings reveal that most procurement decisions are driven by political rather than managerial processes thereby diminishing the levels of authority and responsibility provided to practitioners. To surmount this challenge, practitioners must increase their level of education and expertise as this will offer them extended involvement in the decision making process. Regarding social pressures from families, this is in response to the complex cultural settings and perceptions, where the profession is linked with the ability to provide socio-economic needs of extended families.

The firms submit multidimensional bids, which consist of the quality and the price of the project that they propose to realize. The firms differ in their costs of realizing the project at a given quality, and these costs are private information. The contracting official, in exchange for a bribe, abuses the power of his or her public office by distorting the quality ranking of the bids and by giving the favoured firm an opportunity to readjust its bid to undercut its rivals. Our analysis suggests that when the firms serve only the internal market, the public project is realized at low quality and inflated prices. However, when the firms are also allowed to sell the product they develop for the internal market in a foreign market, the auction is ex post efficient. © 2014 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.;;;"Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., Robinson, J., Institutions as the Cause of Long-Run Growth (2005) Handbook of Economic Growth, Volume 1A, , P.

In this context, it is worth mentioning the sector of public procurement, since it is one of the most sensitive concerning any corruption risk. There have been a number of investments by governments towards the implementation of public e-procurement. Portugal is referenced by the European Commission as a good example in this regard. The question that arises is whether this would have an impact on the degree of trust between the citizens and governance, i.e. regarding perception of corruption. This paper explores the theme ""ICT governance and transparency in the fight against corruption - the case of public e-procurement in Portugal.""

The authors have identified anti-corruption attributes through an extensive literature review and developed a theoretical model representing the impact of four latent variables, monopoly of power, information asymmetry, trust and transparency and accountability on the dependent variable, the intent-to-adopt e-procurement (ITA).Design/methodology/approach – Data for this research were obtained by the use of a questionnaire survey of bidders who were officially registered with the Government of Nepal. As part of the fieldwork for this research, the first author collected the perceptions of 220 bidders regarding the potential of public e-procurement to reduce corruption in public procurement processes.Findings – The findings suggest that a high level of the ITA has a positive and significant relationship with the independent variables that might inform the developed and emerging countries to make a decision to adoption of e-procurement to combat corruption in public procurement.Research limitations/implications – This study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration. The evaluation of anti-corruption factors, as they affect the willingness of users to adopt e-procurement on the bidder’s perception research model is relatively new to e-procurement research. A limitation of the research was that it gathered and analyzed data from a single country with a limited number of respondents. More research is needed to identify the anti-corruption factors of e-procurement in reducing corruption, and also need strong empirical test to valid the factors that influence the adoption of e-procurement.Originality/value – This study aimed to contribute to the academic scholar, government agencies and public procurement practitioner in enhancing their understanding of the perceived anti-corruption factors of public e-procurement to reduce corruption. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Bidders, Corruption, E-procurement, Public procurement;;"Abdi, H., Partial least squares regression (PLS-regression) (2003) Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods, pp. 792-795. , Lewis-Beck, M., Bryman, A. and Futing, T.

In particular, with respect to the Italian organized crime, his research interest has turned to the mechanisms of corruption and the infiltration of the mafia in public procurement. In a recent essay, Savona showed how, by applying the crime script techniques, it would be possible to adopt situational crime prevention measures for each stage of the public procurement process.

In an attempt to do so, 1,521 Cypriots participated between the months of September 2011 and October 2011 in the survey on the level of corruption in Cyprus. The survey was conducted by the organization “Transparency Cyprus”. Participants were 52 per cent female and 48 per cent male, age groups covered by 18 years until retirement, of whom 51 per cent work in the private sector, 16 per cent in the public sector, 24 per cent do not work, while 9 per cent work in semi-governmental organizations. Finally, 34 per cent are high school graduates, 37 per cent had higher education and 29 per cent hold a postgraduate university degree. The survey results show that corruption in Cyprus is considered by the vast majority of participants (86 per cent) as a serious problem and will also increase due to the economic crisis (79 per cent). The majority (93 per cent) of respondents believes that corruption and/or abuse of power for personal benefit exists and is widespread in most national politicians, in government officials in awarding public tenders (92 per cent) and in the police (90 per cent). Design/methodology/approach – In an attempt to verify the perceptions of Cypriot society in relation to corruption, 1,521 Cypriots participated between the months of September 2011 and October 2011 in the survey on the level of corruption in Cyprus. To analyze the results of the survey, the statistical package SPSS has been utilized. Findings – Seventy per cent consider corruption a major issue in Cyprus, while 60 per cent are being or have been affected by corruption directly. Almost all interviewees (92 per cent) believe that the police are also corrupted. Sixty-one per cent believe that not enough is being done to fight corruption, and in the cases that something was done, it was not enough. Seventy-five per cent blame the government, 67 per cent blame the police and 58 per cent blame the prosecutors and judges. Research limitations/implications – On the completion of the upcoming survey (for the year 2013), one can compare these results and identify the associations between the two surveys. Another limitation of this survey is that people could have answered based on their perceptions; therefore, the results should be treated with extra care. Originality/value – This research manuscript takes a step further to deepen our understanding of corruption in Cyprus. The findings of the survey performed could serve as policy prescription for the policy-makers who aim to strengthen the institutional environment in Cyprus. To do so, one should examine the current stage of the environment in Cyprus, something that this research paper explores through the survey conducted. © 2014, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";Corruption, Cyprus, Survey;;"Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., Robinson, J.A., Institutions as the fundamental cause of long-run growth (2005) Handbook of Economic Growth, pp. 385-472. , ”,and (Eds), Elsevier, Amsterdam; Acemoglu, D., Theory, general equilibium, and political economy in development in economics (2010) Journal of Economic Perspecticesm, 24 (3), pp. 17-32; Akai, N., Horiuchi, Y., Sakata, M., (2005) Short-run and long-run effects of corruption on economic growth: evidence from state-level cross-section data for the United States, , ”, Governance Working Paper 555; Huntington, S., (1968) Political Order in Changing Societies, , Yale University Press, New York, NY; Lambert-Mogiliansky, A., Majumdar, M., Radner, R., Strategic analysis of petty corruption: entrepreneurs and bureaucrats (2007) Journal of Development Economics, 83 (2), pp. 351-367; Leff, N., Economic development through bureaucratic corruption (1964) The American Behavioral Scientist, 8 (3), pp. 8-14; Mauro, P., Corruption and growth (1995) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 110 (3), pp. 681-712; Méon, P.G., Sekkat, K., Does corruption grease or sand the wheels of growth?

The act provided for the establishment of channels for objections and complaints, allowing for officials to rapidly deal with controversies, supervise procurement departments, and expose defects in existing procurement procedures. The GPA enhances the efficiency of public purchasing while reducing corruption, raising governmental procurement processes to the international standards. However, the launch of the GPA has been followed by numerous disputes which have reduced the efficiency of public procurement. This study investigated the appeals of ineligible contractors, finding that such appeals are successful in 64% of cases, which implies a systemic failure to achieve justice in the execution of the GPA. Procurement efficiency can be improved if disputes caused incorrect action on the part of government agencies could be avoided. This research uses a case study approach and statistical methods to analyze appeals from ineligible contractors accused of violating the GPA. Comments from the appeal committee are reviewed to develop strategies to reduce disputes regarding contractor ineligibility. A case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. Application results show that the developed strategies could help both the procuring agency and contractor avoid procurement disputes. Suggestions for future revisions of the procurement act are provided. © 2014 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.;case study, dispute, government procurement act, ineligible contractors;;"Abednego, M.P., Ogunlana, S.O., Good project governance for proper risk allocation in public-private partnerships in Indonesia (2006) International Journal of Project Management, 24 (7), pp. 622-634; Cameron, I., Gani, R., (2011) Product and Process Modelling: A Case Study Approach, , Netherland: Elsevier; Chang, H.C., (2006) A Study on Government Procurement Dispute-Based on a Port Authority, , Taiwan: National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung; Chen, J., Huang, H., Kauffman, R.J., A public procurement combinatorial auction mechanism with quality assignment (2011) Decision Support Systems, 51 (3), pp. 480-492; De Silva, D.G., Dunne, T., Kosmopoulou, G., Lamarche, C., Disadvantaged business enterprise goals in government procurement contracting: An analysis of bidding behavior and costs (2012) International Journal of Industrial Organization, 30 (4), pp. 377-388; Elliott, M., Thomas, R., (2011) Public Law, , USA: Oxford University Press; Ertem, M.A., Buyurgan, N., Pohl, E.A., (2012) Using Announcement Options in the Bid Construction Phase for Disaster Relief Procurement; Falagario, M., Sciancalepore, F., Costantino, N., Pietroforte, R., Using a DEA-cross efficiency approach in public procurement tenders (2012) European Journal of Operational Research, 218 (2), pp. 523-529; Glicksman, R.L., Levy, R.E., (2010) Administrative Law: Agency Action in Legal Context, , New York: Foundation Press; Hsu, C.L., (1999) Restraint of Elementary Rights on State Treasury, , Taipei: Angle Publisher; Hsu, C.L., (2002) Mutual Administrative Behavior - Unofficial Negotiation, Agreement, and Administrative Contract, , Taipei: Challenge and Development of New Era and New Economic System, Angle Publisher; Ipsen, H.P., (1972) Europäisches Gemeinschaftsrecht, , Germany: J.C.B.

In some countries, citizens accept corruption as a day-to-day reality with stoic silence, while in others they are determined to fight against it. In all countries, however, there is that moment in time-a tipping point-in which citizens rise up and demand answers and accountability in public life.In India business is simultaneously the reason and the victim of corruption, for a business depends on the eco-system created by the interplay of government and society for its inception and growth.Dynasty has emerged as a major factor in entrenching crony capitalism-among both business and political families. Apart from mutual give-and-take of money and patronage to sustain power equations, there is now also a growing trend of fungibility between business and politics where there is a thin dividing line and people move over from one to the other with consummate ease.However, there are distinct winds of change that give reasonable cause to hope for change. Chief among these are: growing civil society activism, fiercely guarded free media, enabling legislations such as Right to Information Act, Prevention of Money Laundering Act, public procurement legislations, improved justice delivery systems and a pro-active government auditor.Administrators, citizens and businesses alike are moving towards incremental qualitative improvement in accountability rather than disruptive upheaval. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;;"accountability; administrative framework; capitalism; civil society; corruption; economic conditions; governance approach; political economy; state-business relations; India";;Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84897639889

Unfortunately, however, many e-Government projects in developing countries fail. These failures have demonstrated that e-Government strategies need to be adjusted for different cultural contexts; but this is difficult to achieve, given that the bulk of e-Government research has focused on developed countries. This study aim is to fill the gap in the literature on e-Government in developing countries by providing Indonesia's e-Government Procurement (e-Procurement) success as a case study. Significantly, the research will contribute on two issues; first it will focus on organisational adoption (not individual adoption) by a public agency of a pre-existing e-Procurement solution, and as facilitated by a central government agency. Second it will focuses on concern in developing country, especially on how corruption may influence e-Procurement adoption. Recent literature indicates that the quantitative research approach has dominated research in the acceptance of technology. Using this method, the influence of a country's cultural technology acceptance cannot be addressed to a sufficient depth. In order to gain adequate information semi-structured interviews were conducted with CIOs in government agencies. These interviews provided further insight into the specific factor, that is corruption, influencing technology acceptance of electronic procurement in Indonesia. The study found that perceived risk of corruption in manual procurement processes along with perceived usefulness of e-Procurement in combating corruption have motivated public procurement personnel to adopt an electronic government procurement system. © 2014 The Authors.";Developing countries, Electronic government adoption, Electronic procurement, Perceived risk of corruption, Public administration reform, Public procurement;"Crime;

This has been due to over reported mega corruption related cases though in many cases no evidence has ever been produced before any of the statutory procurement bodies. This paper therefore explores the state of procurement system in the country by reviewing the views of Kenyans and media reports. The paper proposes the role of key stakeholders in changing this negative perception. Key conclusions of the paper is that despite public outcry in many cases most of the procurement corruption scandals in the Kenyan scene are sometimes media created and politically engineered as politicians and their brokers seek to outwit each other. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.;Nightmare culture, PPP, Public procurement, Statutory bodies, Vision 2030, Whistleblower;;"Azmi, R.A., Business ethics as competitive advantage for companies in the globalization era (2006), www.scribd.com/doc/30269737/Business-Ethics-asCompetitive-Advantage-for-Companies-in-the-Globalization-Era; The Public Procurement and Disposal Act 2005: Government Printer, Nairobi.

Public procurement can be considered an important instrument in overcoming some of these adversities, particularly in promoting domestic innovative capacities. We tackle some of the main aspects of the connection between public procurement and innovation in Brazil, a relatively recent issue in the country’s political and economic arenas. We argue that the Brazilian government does not have, so far, a procurement policy that can successfully integrate its innovation policy. Its procurement system focuses primarily on fighting corruption, neglecting the quality and the more broad results of purchases. Against this background, two types of policies stand out: sector-specific procurement policies addressing innovation—still rather fresh and few in numbers— and funding policies directed at specific technological areas, which are in turn not integrated into the purchasing power of government. Since these policies have not yet displayed their full potential, we conclude by pointing out the main obstacles on their way. The development of a more consistent association between public procurement and innovation policy in Brazil thus depends on the coordination between different public policies already in existence, the improvement of procurement departments and the better synergy between public and private actors. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.;;;"Abrucio, F., The recent trajectory of Brazilian public management: Critical review and renewal of the reform agenda (2007) Revista de Administração Pública, 41, pp. 77-86; Alveal, C., (1993) Os Desbravadores: A Petrobrás e a construção do Brasil Industrial, , Relume Dumará, Rio de Janeiro Amorim; Neto, O., Critical review: The puzzle of party discipline in Brazil (2002) Lat Am Polit Soc, 44 (1), pp. 127-144; Andrade, A.Z.B.D., (2009) Estudo Comparativo Entre a Subvenção Econômica À Inovação Operada Pela FINEP e Programas Correlatos de Subsídio Em Países Desenvolvidos, , Fundação Getúlio Vargas, Rio de Janeiro; Audet, D., Government procurement: A synthesis report (2002) OECD J Budget, 2 (3), pp. 149-194; Baer, W., Import substitution and industrialization in Latin America: Experiences and interpretations (1972) Lat Am Res Rev, 7, pp. 95-122; Baer, W., (2001) The Brazilian economy: Growth and development, 5th edn, , Greenwood Publishing Group, Westport; BNDES, (2011) Apoio À Inovação, , http://www.bndes.gov.br/SiteBNDES/export/sites/default/bndes_pt/Galerias/Arquivos/conhecimento/cartilha/cartilha_apoio_inovacao.pdf, Accessed January 2012; BNDES, (2012) BNDES Profarma-Inovação-BNDES, , http://www.bndes.gov.br/SiteBNDES/bndes/bndes_pt/Institucional/Apoio_Financeiro/Programas_e_Fundos/Profarma/profarma_inovacao.html, Accessed 24 January 2012; Boschi, R., Diniz, E., (2004) Empresários, Interesses e Mercado, Dilemas do Desenvolvimento no Brasil (Entrepreneurs, Interests and Market: Dilemmas of Development in Brazil), , Editora UFMG, Belo Horizonte; Bresser-Pereira, L.C., The Dutch disease and its neutralization (2008) Revista de Economia Política, 28, pp. 47-71; Bresser-Pereira, L.C., An account of new developmentalism and its structuralist macroeconomics (2011) Revista de Economia Política, 31, pp. 339-351; Burlamaqui, L., Souza, J.A.P., Barbosa-Filho, N.H., (2006) The rise and halt of economic development in Brazil, 1945-2004: Industrial catching-up, institutional innovation and financial fragility, , http://www.elgermen.com.ar/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/brazil-45-04.pdf, World Institute for Development Economics Research; Calandrini, N., (2012) Brasil inova na produção de antirretroviral, , http://site.protec.org.br/farmacos_detalhe.php?id=20359&NOT%CDCIAS%20PROTEC:%20Brasil%20inova%20na%20produ%E7%E3o%20de%20antirretroviral, Notícias Protec.

The public Private Partnerships (PPP) has been in use for almost two decades helping developed countries improve their infrastructure stock to achieve their economic goals. Despite the link between infrastructure availability and economic growth, developing countries are yet to achieve adequate infrastructure provision to assist their quest for economic growth. Therefore, this study set out to determine the reasons for the slow adoption of the PPP procurement strategy in Nigeria through a survey of construction professionals. It was found that corruption in government was the major problem. Factor analysis further revealed five factors namely Government policy on infrastructure, Lack of consensus among policy makers, Political instability, Lack of understanding of the PPP concept, and High participation costs. © 2014 The Authors.

It is recommended that management consider building professional networking opportunities, identify opportunities for country-level networking and mentoring, as well as communities of practice related to procurement through supply chain management (SCM); engage existing professional associations (private and public sector) for example Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. It is also recommended that segregation of duties among SCM practitioners will bring about efficiency in procurement practices. This implies that employees understand and see the need for the segregation of duties, as one of the elements with which to curb fraud and bring about efficiency in SCM operations, this was strongly agreed by 63 percent of the respondents. It is further recommended that there must be a review of current legislation that regulates Public Sector procurement. This infers that Public Sector procurement legislation does not address the needs of public procurement ultimately service delivery, a collective 59 percent of the respondents strongly agreed.";Compliance, Legislation, Service delivery, Supply chain management;;"(2003) Our Companies, Sainsbury's, , http://www.jsainsbury.co.uk/about/operation_supermarket.htm, Anon., Accessed 23 February; (2008) Audit report for 2007/2008 financial year. 1st quarter, , Auditor-General of South Africa., South Africa.

The authors identified anticorruption capabilities of e-procurement through an extensive literature review and a theoretical model representing the impact of three latent variables: monopoly of power, information asymmetry, and transparency and accountability upon the dependent variable, the intent-to-adopt e-procurement. This research was guided by the Principal- Agent theory and collected the perceptions of 46 government officers of the potential of public e-procurement to reduce corruption in public procurement processes. Results were analysed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. The findings suggest that the intent-to-adopt e-procurement has a positive and significant relationship with the independent variables that might inform developing countries in strategies to combat corruption in public procurement.;Accountability, Anti-corruption, Information asymmetry, Monopoly power, Public e-procurement, Public procurement, Transparency;;"Abdi, H., Partial least squares regression (PLS-regression) (2003) Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods, pp. 792-795. , M Lewis-Beck, Bryman, A., & Futing, T.

A corrupt politician, who acts on behalf of the public sector, receives a kickback from the winning bidder. The politician selects the scoring rule. The paper shows that such corruption always leads to lower quality and lower price. Given a level of corruption, a higher bargaining power of the politician in extracting bribes does not affect the quality but leads to higher price. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;Corruption, Public procurement, Scoring auction;;"Asker, J., Cantillon, E., Properties of scoring auctions (2008) RAND J.

This initiated adoption of new laws according to the best practice from European countries regulations. The area of public procurement was one of them, with major aim to increase the transparency and concurrency in the procurement process in order to make it more efficient. During last 10 years, we saw the rise and fall of procurement process in Serbia. Initially, new rules gave positive results, with constantly increasing amount of realized procurements and 7.2 as an average number of bidders per procurement in 2004. In order to support the process and make it more visible, Internet portal for procurement was deployed. Unfortunately, in the next period number of irregular procurements constantly increased while number of bidders decreased to an average of 2.7 in 2011. Analysts agree that major problems in the process are poor application of regulations and high level of corruption. Further, they identified three phases of procurement where corruption usually happen: planning phase, setting up estimation criteria and realization phase. Our proposal is to introduce semantic technologies in the process, in order to enable data manipulation by machines. We propose meta-model for the definition of procurement documents, and another one meta-model for the specification of alert rules, together with domain-specific language. This would enable an expert to set up rules regarding specific conditions, in order to be alerted about possibly irregular procurements. Application of proposed solution should enable earlier recognition of potentially irregular procurements, which can be prevented before realization or sanctioned prior to obsolescence. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;Domain-specific language, MDA, Public procurement, Rule-based system, Semantic technologies;"Crime;

Political corruption is indicated by empirical results for 29 OECD countries for the period 1996-2009: allocation of public spending to expenditure categories characterized by high-technology goods supplied by non-competitive industries varies positively with the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) provided by Transparency International. Previous literature on corruption in government has focused on low-income countries. The results of this study suggest that political corruption is also an issue in OECD countries. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.;Budget composition, Corruption, Public procurement, Rent creation, Rent seeking;;"(2002) Governance, Corruption, and Economic Performance, , International Monetary Fund, Washington, DC, G.T.

Public e-Procurement is the use of an Internet or Web-based system by government institutions for the acquisition of goods and services, which can improve transparency and accountability. This chapter discusses different types of e-Procurement technologies with case examples from different countries that demonstrate how the e- Procurement technologies have great potential as the anti-corruption technologies. The chapter reviews the Principal-Agent Theory and discusses other relevant theories including Transaction Cost Theory, Fraud Triangle Theory, Diffusion of Innovation Theory, and the Technology Acceptance Model. Following a discussion of the potential of e-Procurement systems in mitigating corruption, a theoretical research model is proposed for identifying public e-Procurement anti-corruption capabilities. © 2014, IGI Global.;;;"Aboelmaged, M.G., Predicting e-procurement adoption in a developing country: An empirical integration of technology acceptance model and theory of planned behaviour (2010) Industrial Management & Data Systems, 110 (3-4), pp. 392-414; Albrecht, W.S., Albrecht, C.C., Albrecht, C.O., Fraud and corporate executives: Agency stewardship and broken trust (2004) Journal of Forensic Accounting, 5 (1), pp. 109-130; Amagoh, F., Information asymmetry and the contracting out process (2009) The Innovation Journal: The Public Sector Innovation Journal, 14 (2), pp. 1-14; Angelov, S., Grefen, P., An e-contracting reference architecture (2008) Journal of Systems and Software, 81 (11), pp. 1816-1844; Bacharach, S.B., Organizational theories: Some criteria for evaluation (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14 (4), pp. 496-515; Bachmann, R., Inkpen, A.C., Understanding institutional-based trust building processes in inter-organizational relationships (2011) Organization Studies, 32 (2), pp. 281-301; Betts, M., Black, P., Christensen, S.A., Dawson, E., Du, R., Duncan, W., Towards secure and legal e-tendering (2010) Journal of Information Technology in Construction, 11, pp. 89-102; Bhattacherjee, A., (2012) Social science research: Principles, methods, and practices, , http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/oa_textbooks/3/, 2nd Ed., Reterived February 5, 2013 form; Bikshapathi, K., RamaRaju, P., Bhatnagar, S., Ahmedabad, I., (2006) E-procurement in government of Andhra Pradesh India, , Washington, DC: World Bank; Block, C., Neumann, D., A decision support system for choosing market mechanisms in e-procurement (2008) Negotiation, auctions, and market engineering, pp. 44-57. , Berlin: Springer; Boer, L., Harink, J., Heijboer, G., (2001) A model for assessing the impact of electronic procurement forms., , Paper presented at the 10th International Annual IPSERA Conference.

Relying on statistic data the author of the article argues that crimes in governmental procurement sphere are the ones which are most often caused by corruption. She is convinced that transferring of money from state budget to hidden economy damages national security and demonstrates imperfect regulation in this sphere by Kazakhstan legislature.

The problems of the Czech procurement market have been demonstrated on the analysis of a sample of contracts awarded by local government entities. From among a set of factors influencing the efficiency of public procurement, we closely analyse transparency, resilience against corruption, openness, effective administrative award procedure, and formulation of appropriate evaluation criteria for selecting the most suitable bid. Some assumptions were confirmed, including a positive effect of open procedures on the level of competition on the supply side as well as the dominant use of price criteria only. The latter case is probably often caused by low skills of workers at the contracting entities, as well as the lack of resources in public budgets. However, we have to reject the persistent legend of ""undershooting"" tender prices and subsequently increasing the final prices of public contracts. Increases of final prices are very limited. Based on the results of the analyses presented, we argue that the main problem of the Czech public procurement market lies in a rather low competence of administrators who are not able to use non-price criteria more often. © 2013 František Ochrana, Jan Pavel.";Competition, Corruption, Czech republic, Public procurement, Transparency;;"Bajari, P., Tadelis, S., Incentives versus Transaction Costs: A Theory of Procurement Contracts (2001) Rand Journal of Economics. 2001, 32 (3), pp. 387-407; Beblavý, M., Sicáková-Beblavá, E., Inŝtitucionálne dilemy pri zabezpecení verejných služieb (2006), [Institutional dilemmas in securing public services],Bratislava: Transparency International, Adin.s. r. o; Císarová, E., Zakázky malého rozsahu v Ceské republice (2009), [Small-scale public contracts in the Czech Republic] Praha: TIC; Domberger, S., Rimmer, S., Competitive Tendering and Contracting in the Public Sector: A Survey (1994) International Journal of the Economics of Business, 1, pp. 439-453; Fric, P., (2011) Korupce, , [Corruption].

So pervasive is corruption in Nigeria that almost every aspect of national life is affected one way or the other. The present magnitude of corruption in Nigeria is traceable to the many years of military rule where due process was not observed in public procurement and contract bidding. Both the private and public sectors of the country are affected by various forms of corruption. As a consequence, the impact of governance in the country is impeded and if a check is not put in place, Nigeria will be left behind in the development agenda of world bodies. It is a trite fact that corruption in one place is connected to others, and enabled by systems of weak regulations and poor oversight. Human societies have been known to be bedeviled by corruption but some have been able to combat this menace by putting statutes in place to criminalize corruption and ensuring that enforcement mechanisms are enabled to act. This paper, therefore explores public and private sector governance in Nigeria with a view to exposing the various forms of corruption in the country. The paper took the position that corruption plays a dominant role in the development deficit in the country and examined the philosophical and psychological reasons for corruption. The paper also x-rayed the devastating effects of corruption which includes underdevelopment, negative image of the country, and impact on the global market, the paper concludes by questioning the existing anti-corruption strategies in the country and proposed the way they can be made to work.;;;"Awuzie, U., (2011) Press Statement at the end of National Executive Council Meeting of Academic Staff Union of Universities held at ABU, , Zaria, 5-16 May, 2011; Ayoade, A.A., The Audacity of Corruption (2011) The National Scholars, 8 (1), pp. 38-40. , In; Dike, V.E., (2010) Managing the Challenges of Corruption in Nigeria, , Centre for Social Justice and Human Development, Sacramento, California; Ekanem, S.A., (2010) How the Military Underdeveloped Nigeria, , Calabar: University of Calabar Press; Faseke, M., Corruption and the Image of the Nigerian Civil Service: A historical Discourse (2010) The Constitutions.

But this economic growth has come at a high environmental cost. In China approximately 750,000 premature deaths a year are attributed to high levels of environmental pollution. With the recent 12th Five Year Plan (FYP) China's leadership announced the launching of a green revolution that would balance the need for robust economic growth with concern for the environment and combating climate change. This paper utilizes a rent-seeking framework to explore some of the obstacles inhibiting more environmentally sustainable policies in China. We describe the situation as a struggle over the proper aligning of the individual actor's behavior within an opportunistic governance structure, and we argue that rent seeking and corruption creates substantial hurdles to promoting green environmental practices and programs. © 2013 National Association of Environmental Professionals.;;"economic growth; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; policy approach; rent seeking; sustainability; sustainable development; China";"Barbier, E.B., (2010) Rethinking the Economic Recovery: A Global Green New Deal, , Cambridge University Press, New York; Chou, B.K.P., Challenges for china's reform of government procurement (2006) Journal of Contemporary China, 15 (48), pp. 533-549; Dollar, D., Hofman, B., Intergovernmental fiscal reforms, expenditure assignment, and governance (2006) Roundtable Conference on Public Finance for A Harmonious Society, , June 27-28, 2006, Beijing, China; Easton, D., An approach to the analysis of political systems (1957) World Politics, 9 (3), pp. 383-400; http://ec.europa.eu/enrivonment/GPP, Europa.

About one-third of managers report that firms like theirs bribe to secure a public contract, paying about 8 % of the contract value. Econometric estimations suggest that national governance factors, such as democratic accountability, press freedom, and rule of law, are associated with lower bribery. Larger and foreign-owned firms are less likely to bribe than smaller domestic ones. But among bribers, foreign and domestic firms pay similar amounts.

Design/methodology/approach: The research for the paper is based on reports by international organizations, official documents of the Philippines government, surveys by international and domestic organizations, interviews with relevant officials and media reports. Findings: The findings show that the reforms have focused on fostering competition, increasing transparency, standardizing procedures, enhancing end-product quality and contractor reliability, ensuring proper planning and budgeting, combatting corruption, and strengthening accountability. These reforms were intended to create a procurement system more in line with international best practices. However the paper shows that the impact has been less than promised. This is due to limitations of certain provisions of the reforms and weaknesses in both implementation and in the accountability of the procuring entities. A key factor in undermining the reforms is widespread corruption, which continues to affect many aspects of the procurement system. The article identifies two important and related reasons for such failings: elite capture of the government and bureaucracy by a powerful network of business leaders from well-established landed families, who have close links with the political establishment; and second, a long-established culture of informal influence in the Philippine state bureaucracy (what may be termed the informal bureaucracy), which has been used to maximum effect by the elite network of business leaders. As a result, this network has been able to influence the reforms to serve its own interests and ensure its continued dominance of the procurement market. Originality/value: The value of the paper is to show how administrative reforms, no matter how well formulated they are, may be readily undermined in the process of implementation by elite groups able to influence government bureaucracy through an informal culture. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";Corruption, Elite capture, Government policy, Implementation, Informal bureaucracy, Philippines, Public administration, Public procurement, Public sector reform, Reform;;"Adams, G., Hayes, S., Weierter, S., Boyd, J., Regulatory capture: Managing the risk (2007), paper presented at Australian Public Sector Anti-Corruption Conference, Sydney, 24 October; (2010) Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2010, , ADB, Manila,ADB; (2009) Republic of the Philippines: Strengthening the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement System, , Technical Assistance Report, ADB, Manila,ADB; (2006) Anti-Corruption Policies in Asia and the Pacific: Thematic Review on Provisions and Practices to Curb Corruption in Public Procurement: Self-Assessment Report, , ADB and OECD, Manila,ADB and OECD; (2006) Curbing Corruption in Public Procurement in Asia Ad the Pacific: Progress and Challenges in 25 Countries, , ADB and OECD, Manila,ADB and OECD; Aquino stops helicopter deals over alleged graft (2010) Philippine Daily Inquirer, (5). , October,Presse Agence France; Bottomore, T., (1993) Elites and Society, , Routledge, London, 2nd ed; Brillantes, A.B., Philippines (2009) Public Administration and Public Governance in ASEAN Member Countries and Korea, pp. 183-224. , Kim, P.

In this article an account is given of research that has highlighted that public procurement should be grasped not by concentrating on corruption, but, on the contrary, even assuming good intentions. Self-cleaning, probity auditing and the identification of illicit conduct are positive means of prevention. The brute force approach of hard law and penalisation is not the only way. However, the draft directives do not reflect this recognition. © 2013 ERA.;Corruption, Ethical procurement, Probity, Self-cleaning;;"Arrowsmith, S., Priess, H.-J., Friton, P., Self-cleaning-an emerging concept in EC public procurement law?

The RIVM put the immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) for the programme out to public tender, after which a panel of experts recommended the FOB Gold test. This is surprising since previous studies favoured the OC Sensor test and the FOB Gold test has never been used in the Netherlands. Before starting the national programme in September 2013, the RIVM wants to ascertain which FOB Gold test cut-off value is comparable with the 75 ng/ml of the OC Sensor test recommended by the Health Council of the Netherlands. This cut-off level is crucial for capacity planning of colonoscopies. We advocate starting the national screening programme with the OC Sensor test and subsequent careful comparison with the FOB Gold test during the screening programme.;;"cancer screening; colonoscopy; colorectal cancer; gold standard; occult blood test; review; article; colorectal tumor; early diagnosis; human; mass screening; methodology; Netherlands; occult blood; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Mass Screening; Netherlands; Occult Blood";"Bevolkingsonderzoek naar darmkanker Publicatienr. 2009/13, p. 2009. , Gezondheidsraad.

It adopts a moral schema framework to examine procurement-induced corruption from Uganda. Experiences, attitudes, and values of respondents are used to construct future behavior of public procurement staff. The schema framework was built around the premise that procurement-related corruption is a function of the social framework and human nature paradox, constructing logical justification for the acts of corruption. The study uses data from 474 public procurement staff to demonstrate that social identity, ethical egoistic, legislative, amoral, and religious moral schemas account for 78. 51% of the variance in moral schema of respondents. All these schemas were found to be significant predictors, accounting for 73. 3% of public procurement corruption. The paper urges managers of procuring and disposing entities to utilize moral scripts in reducing corruption. Managers are encouraged to engage in morally responsible behaviors to promote ethics and value-for-money transactions. The paper provides an alternative framework for examining corruption in sub-Saharan Africa where explicit elaboration of insights on corruption is still lacking. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.;Corruption, Ethics, Moral schemas, Religious values, Social values, Uganda;;"Amanda, L.M., (1998) Corruption: Causes, consequences, and policy implications, , October, The Asia Foundation Working Paper #9; Ashforth, B., Mael, F., Social identity theory and the organization (1989) The Academy of Management Review, 14, pp. 20-39; (2008) Special Audit on Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) Expenditure, , Auditor General, The Republic of Uganda; Barr, A., Serra, D., (2006) Culture and Corruption, GPRG-WPS-040, , http://www.gprg.org, Global Poverty Research Group, Centre for the Study of African Economies, University of Oxford, UK; Baruch, Y., Holtom, B.C., Survey response rate levels and trends in organizational research (2008) Human Relations, 61 (8), pp. 1139-1160; Basheka, B.C., Economic and political determinants of public procurement corruption in developing countries: An empirical study from Uganda (2011) Journal of Public Procurement, 11 (1), pp. 33-60; Bigne, E., Kuster, I., Toran, F., Market orientation and industrial sales-force: Diverse measure instruments (2003) Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing, 18 (1), pp. 59-81; Brewer, M.B., The social self: On being the same and different at the same time (1991) Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 17, pp. 475-482; Cappel, J., Windsor, J., A comparative investigation of ethical decision making: Information systems professionals versus students (1998) The Database for Advances in Information Systems, 29 (2), pp. 20-34; Clarke, G.R.G., Colin-Xu, L., (2002) Ownership, Competition, and Corruption: Bribe Takers Versus Bribe Payers, , Policy Research Working Paper 2783.

The goal of this research is to analyse factors that influence the level of bribery in public procurement. The investigation is based on data from two surveys. The first was conducted by the Institute for Industrial and Market Studies at the National Research University - Higher School of Economics. The second is the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey. We use binary response, ordered logit models and probit models with sample selection in this paper. Our econometric study demonstrates that incentives to bribe are higher in sectors with strong competition. Holding company members and the companies owned by the state are less involved in bribery than are private firms. The probability of bribery increases if unpredictable government regulation and political instability heavily influence enterprise performance.

The scale and the complexity of the roles to be considered can prevent the use of most audit methods and technologies so successful on the corporate world. The aim of this chapter is to propose a data mining method, based on naïve Bayes classifiers, to support a generic risk assessment process for audit planning. The method can sort auditable units by total risk score, fostering dedicated audit coverage to high-risk areas. Audit organizations can transition from a reactive response to a proactive approach to identify and correct issues that may be indicative of fraud, waste or abuse. Extensive databases containing records from government operations can be combined to auditors knowledge, fraud profiles, impact factors or any other relevant metric in order to rank an audit universe. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.;data mining, probabilistic classifiers, public sector corruption, risk analysis;"Crime; Data mining; Knowledge based systems; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Assessment process; Bayes Classifier; Data mining methods; Governmental agency; Pro-active approach; Probabilistic classifiers; Public procurement; Public sector; Management";"Coderre, D., Auditing - Computer-Assisted Techniques for Fraud Detection (1999) The CPA Journal, , August; (2011) Government Auditing Standards (The Yellow Book), , United States Government Accountability Office (GAO): August; Vito, K.W., SPHR, CCP, Auditing Employee Hiring and Staffing (2011) The IIA Research Foundation, , June; International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) (2009) The IIA Research Foundation, , The Institute of Internal Auditors; Ngai, E.W.T., Yong, H.Y.H., Wong, Y.C., Sun, X., The application of data mining techniques in financial fraud detection: A classification framework and an academic review of literature (2011) Decision Support Systems, pp. 559-569; Panigrahi, S., Kundu, A., Sural, S., Majumdar, A.K., Credit card fraud detection: A fusion approach using Dempster Shafer theory and Bayesian learning (2009) Information Fusion, 10 (4), pp. 354-363; Phua, C., Lee, V., Smith, K., Gayler, R., A comprehensive survey of data mining-based fraud detection research (2005) Artificial Intelligence Review, pp. 1-14; Hormazi, A.M., Giles, S., Data Mining: A Competitive Weapon for Banking and Retail Industries (2004) Information Systems Management, 21 (2), pp. 62-71; Nilsen, T., Aven, T., Models and model uncertainty in the context of risk analysis (2003) Reliability Engineering and System Safety, 79, pp. 309-331; Nilsen, T., (2003) Foundations of Risk Analysis: A Knowledge and Decision-Oriented Perspective, , John Wiley and Sons Ltd., West Sussex; Viaene, S., Derrig, R.A., Dedene, G., A Case Study of Applying Boosting Naive Bayes to Claim Fraud Diagnosis (2004) IEEE Transactions On Knowledge and Data Engineering, 16 (5), pp. 612-620; Viaene, S., Derrig, R.A., Baesens, B., Dedene, G., A Comparison of State-of-the-Art Classification Techniques for Expert Automobile Insurance Claim Fraud Detection (2002) J.

In South Africa corruption, also in public procurement, is rife. One of the causes is that perpetrators are not held accountable. To ensure accountability, political and other undue influence in both the procurement process and the process of holding people accountable must be curbed. In the matter of Glenister v President of the Republic of South Africa and others, the Constitutional Court of South Africa held that the Bill of Rights creates a duty to establish an anti-corruption unit with appropriate independence. It can be argued, on the basis of this judgment, that on a purposive interpretation of section 7(2), section 195(1) and section 217(1) of the Constitution there is a positive duty on the state to ensure accountability in public procurement. This will include that political and undue influence in the procurement process and the process of holding people accountable be actively curbed.

A number of legislation, which controls a range of public procurement, were legitimated because of the requirement to regulate purchases from national budget, after the restoration of independence of the Republic of Lithuania. The paper analyzes the legal context of the electronic public procurement and particular attention is paid to business development and corporate competitiveness in the EU (European Union). By 2010, all EU countries should have been installed electronic public procurement systems and at least 50 percent of public procurement should have been made in this way. For a membership of different countries, procurer's participation is essential for EU and the Republic of Lithuania's domestic economy because of safe competition in all EU. Implementation of a model of e-government (electronic government) services, such as government for business and business for government related with electronic public procurement, which helps to reduce bureaucracy, simplifies formal procedures, saves civil servants time and public money, improves product's and service's quality and promotes competition between suppliers, public and private sectors partnership. E-government is an integral part of modern economics, called as the knowledge economy. E-government helps to reduce bureaucracy and simplify formal procedures, while civil servants are saving time and public money, improves product quality of purchased services and promotes competition between suppliers, public and private sectors collaboration and partnership.;Corruption, Electronic government, Electronic public procurement, Private sector, Public service;;"(2010) Apie Centrinȩ Viešu̧ju̧ Pirkimu̧ Sistema̧.

Good governance ought to be participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective, efficient, equitable, inclusive and follows the rule of law. In our context, it assures that corruption is minimised, the views of minorities are taken into account and that the voices of the most vulnerable in society are heard in decision-making. Local governments globally have been established as key public service delivery centres. However, this function at the local government level has had serious concerns about graft and procurement-related malpractice hence undermining the role government officials responsible for public funds. Such incidences suggest serious impediments to the governance agenda in Uganda's public sector. Using a survey of respondents from Uganda's four regions, we examine the forms of procurement corruption that threaten many lives of poor citizens through denial of effective services.

The fight against economic-political corruption is a risky question, because the hunters and the hunted, those who conduct and those who undergo impeachment, are often members of the same political elite. It is in the interest of tax-payers that public funds should not become cash bribes, and furthermore that the rule of corruption should not grow dominant in even a single sphere. If we consider the moral weakness of politicians as the genesis of economic and political corruption, then the appropriate anti-corruption strategy would be the right combination of penalty policy and payment policy.";Corruption, Lose their legitimacy, Penalty policy, Price of democracy, Public procurement;;"Bicchieri, C., Duffy, J., (1997) Corruption Cycles.

Design&sol;methodology&sol;approachThis paper examines relevant provisions of the code of conduct for public officers in the Constitution of Nigeria, and other statutes directed at curbing official corruption, and then undertakes an assessment of their impact in the fight against corruption. The assessment is drawn from the direct pronouncements and actions of the highest political figures in Nigeria since return to civilian rule in 1999, and the views of policy makers and implementers, development partners and academics on the anti&hyphen;corruption fight in Nigeria. FindingsSince the advent of civilian rule in 1999, the Nigerian government has introduced several reforms through the enactment of new constitutional provisions and statutes directed at official corruption. The code of conduct provisions in the Constitution provides for and enforces an ethical guide for public officers&semi; the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act &lpar;ICPC Act&rpar; prohibits corruption in the conduct of government business generally&semi; the Public Procurement Act &lpar;PPA&rpar; introduced mandatory requirements of transparency, and prohibits nepotism, inflation of contract and other corrupt acts in the award of government contracts&semi; while the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative Act &lpar;NEITI Act&rpar; introduced mandatory requirements of transparency and disclosure in extractive industries. Although the government introduced these reforms with enthusiasm, it has shown a lack of will power to implement them to a logical conclusion. The result is that the reform measures introduced through these legal provisions have not had any substantial impact in curbing corruption in the respective sectors covered by them. Research limitations&sol;implicationsThis paper is restricted to an examination of the impact of legal provisions directed against official corruption in Nigeria. It does not discuss legal provisions directed at economic and financial crimes in Nigeria. Originality&sol;valueThis paper presents an assessment of the impact of the legal provisions directed at curbing official corruption in Nigeria since 1999. The assessment reflects the views and attitudes of the highest ranking public officers, technocrats in charge of implementation of the legal reforms, legislators, development partners and informed academics. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";Anti&hyphen,corruption, Code of conduct, Corruption, Extractive industries, Nigeria, Public administration, Public procurement, Transparency;;"Abonyi, I., High cost of projects execution worries Jonathan (2010) ThisDay, (June 15), pp. 1-4. , &lpar;

Traditionally, local governments present unequal development, at least in terms of the level of resources and the size of population looked after. Moreover, many studies show that municipalities have lead the ranking in the perception of corruption in Chile. Two hypotheses were proposed. The first is that the impacts and benefits, that the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)-driven reform have had on public procurement tend to be less than desired. The second affirms that an e-procurement system can significantly augment the level of transparency; however, an automatic reduction in the level of corruption will not be apparent. The study was based on two surveys conducted with municipality buyers and vendors. Corruption and transparency were chosen as the primary focus. Other impacts measured include the efficiency of the internal processes, cultural aspects and normative and institutional aspects. The most relevant conclusions were two - the reform of public procurement in Chile increased the level of transparency; and the greatest transparency perceived in purchasing processes has not shown a lessening in the level of corruption.

The research set out to examine the relationships between factors including perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, trust, and intent to adopt anti-corruption technology in public procurement. The research was guided by the Technology Acceptance model and Principal-agent theory. The findings suggest that the intent-to-adopt public e-procurement has a positive and significant relationship with concepts of usefulness, ease of use, and trust when democratic governments in developing countries attempt to combat corruption in public procurement.;Intent-to-adopt e-procurement, Perceived benefits, Public e-procurement, Technology acceptance;;"Alam, S.S., Noor, M., Kamal, M., ICT Adoption in Small and Medium Enterprises: an Empirical Evidence of Service Sectors in Malaysia (2009) International Journal of Business and Management, 4 (2), pp. 112-125; Al-moalla, A., Li, D., Organisational Issues with Electronic Government Procurement A Case Study of the UAE (2010) The Electronic Journal on Information Systems in Developing Countries, 41 (3), pp. 1-18; Alsaghier, H., Ford, M., Nguyen, A., Hexel, R., Conceptualising Citizen's Trust in e-Government: Application of Q Methodology (2009) Electronic Journal of E-government, 7 (4), pp. 295-310; Andersen, T.B., (2008) E-Government as an Anti-Ccorruption Tool, , Department of Economics University of Copenhagen Denmark; (2007) Fighting Corruption in Afghanistan A Roadmap for Strategy and Action, , http://www.unodc.org/pdf/afg/anti_corruption_roadmap.pdf, Asian Development Bank; Bacharach, S.B., Organizational Theories Some Criteria for Evaluation (1989) Academy of Management Review, 14 (4), pp. 496-515; Bannon, L., (1999), http://www.iadb.org/regions/re2/consultative_group/groups/transparency_w orkshop6.htm, The Fight Against Corruption: A World Bank Perspective; Basant, R., Commander, S., Harrison, R., Menezes-filho, N., (2006) ICT Adoption and Productivity in Developing Countries, p. 2294. , New Firm Level Evidence from Brazil and India, IZA Discussion Paper; Bélanger, F., Carter, L., Trust and Risk in E-government Adoption (2008) The Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 17 (2), pp. 165-176; Bertot, J.C., Jaeger, P.T., Grimes, J.M., Crowd-sourcing Transparency: ICTs, Social Media, and Government Transparency Initiatives (2010) Proceedings of the 11th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research; Bhattacherjee, A., (2012) Social Science Research: Principles, Methods, and Practices, , http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/oa_textbooks/3/, 2nd edition, Open Access Textbooks; Bhattari, P., (2012) Progress on Graft, , Rupablica 6 March; Bhattari, P., (2012) Corruption in Security Sector, , Rupablica, 15 April; Braund, P., Frauscher, K., Schwittay, A., Petkoski, D., (2007) Information and Communications Technology for Economic Development Exploring Possibilities for Multi-sector Technology Collaborations, , Global E-Discussion, The World Bank; Brun, A., Ronchi, S., Fan, X., Golini, R., What is the Value of an IT EProcurement System (2010) Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management, 16, pp. 131-140; Carter, L., Bélanger, F., The Utilization of E-Government Services: Citizen Trust, Innovation and Acceptance Factors (2005) Information Systems Journal, 15, pp. 5-25; Chan, J.K.Y., Lee, M.K.O., SME E-procurement Adoption in Hong Kong - The Roles of Power, Trust and Value (2003) Proceedings of the 36th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences; Chang, H.H., Wong, K.H., Adoption of E-procurement and Participation of Emarketplace on Firm Performance: Trust as a Moderator (2010) Information & Management, 47 (5), pp. 262-270; Cheng, T., Lam, D.Y.C., Yeung, A.C.L., Adoption of Internet Banking: An Empirical Study in Hong Kong (2006) Decision Support Systems, 42 (3), pp. 1558-1572; Cordella, A., (2005) The Role of Information and Communication Technology in Building Trust in Governance, , Towards Effectiveness and Results, in: Vitro, R (ed.)

Extracting useful information to enhance cartel detection is a complex problem from many perspectives due to the large volume of data used to correlate information and the dynamic and diversified strategies companies use to hide their fraudulent operations. To attack the problem of data volume, we have used two data mining model functions, clustering and association rules, and a multi-agent approach to address the dynamic strategies of companies that are involved in cartel formation. To integrate both solutions, we have developed AGMI, an agent-mining tool that was validated using real data from the Brazilian Office of the Comptroller General, an institution of government auditing, where several measures are currently used to prevent and fight corruption. Our approach resulted in explicit knowledge discovery because AGMI presented many association rules that provided a 90% correct identification of cartel formation, according to expert assessment. According to auditing specialists, the extracted knowledge could help in the detection, prevention and monitoring of cartels that act in public procurement processes. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It argues that bribery is a substitute for being connected and statistically tests various forms of this proposition in the context of Bulgaria. This approach is tested with two illegitimate goals (hiding and circumvention) of economic behavior and two legitimate goals (influencing laws and public procurement) that might be achieved by noncompliant means. The findings suggest that bribery is used primarily when companies are engaged in hidden economic activities and circumvention of the law, while networks turn out to be the only significant variable when firms attempt to influence new legislation or acquire public procurement contracts. © 2012 M.E.

One purpose of such procurement is to lower the costs of the procured service and another is for the political level to gain better control over what it is purchasing. However, monitoring problems exist when conducting public procurements; recent studies indicate that actions related to public servant corruption are most common in public procurement processes. Citing cases from Sweden, this article argue that, in the case of public procurement, private firms have assumed a monitoring role towards the public sector similar to that of whistleblowers, and that the public system in fact depends on private firms to detect procurement bypasses committed by civil servants. This article provides an understanding of this monitoring role and discusses its theoretical and practical implications for the public system. I conclude that upholding the public system is not the primary objective of the private whistleblower but a positive side effect. The monitoring role is analyzed in the framework of principal-agent theory and should be seen as complementary to the existing monitoring functions available to public principals. © 2012 De Gruyter.

However, cost and time escalation and poor quality are commonplace due to weak governance and endemic corruption. There is considerable evidence that transparency and oversight are potentially powerful tools to reduce the impact of corruption. This paper argues that a comparatively cheap and potentially powerful tool to improve outcomes in public procurement is regular publication of contract and implementation details.

The government prohibited the most part of qualification criteria in the selection process and used open auctions as the main tool of contract placement. However simplification of procurement procedures led to opportunism on the side of suppliers. In this paper using the unique dataset of 2000 contracts executed in 2008-2010 for a large public customer we define the factors explaining the risk of suppliers non-performance. Econometric analysis showed that under current procurement regulation in Russia the risks of suppliers non-performance are higher for large contracts, contracts executed in October-December and contracts placed at open auctions. However contrary to anecdotal evidences, initial price decrease does not influence the performance of contractors. © 2012, Russian Presidental Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.

After a literature review, the study adopted a qualitative and quantitative approach based on textual analysis methods, case studies and the general opinions of the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption. Research shows that corruption has negative effects on the rule of law because public officials who violate due process reduce citizens' trust in formal institutions, causing adverse economic effects and environmental destruction. A study of the cases of corruption detected also reveals that most of these breaches of duty violate the constitutional principles of legality, where public authorities should be bound to the law and the Constitution. This is mostly shown in public procurement procedures; in managing state property and resources; in employment; and in the work of functionaries. The study is limited to corrupt practices in Slovenia, the results of which will be especially useful in identifying the main causes and reasons behind the emergence of corruption. In this work, we have identified the key characteristics, problems and areas of corruption and their impact on different entities; in doing so, the risks of corrupt practices become evident, making it easier to develop better standards of prevention.";Commission for the Prevention of Corruption, Corruption, Opinion of principle, Prevention, Rule of law;;"Babbie, E.R., (2007) The Practice of Social Research, , Belmont: Thomson Wadsworth; Borlini, S.L., (2008) Dottorato in Internacionale Del Economia, , Milano: Universita Bocconi; Bučar Ručman, A., Medijsko poročanje o kriminaliteti v Sloveniji (2011) Revija Za Kriminalistiko in Kriminologijo, 62 (1), pp. 239-248; Chowdhury, S.K., The effect of democracy and press freedom on corruption: An empirical test (2004) Economics Letters, 85 (1), pp. 93-101; Dobovšek, B., (2008) Korupcija v Tranziciji, , Ljubljana: Fakulteta za varnostne vede; Dobovšek, B., Meško, G., Informal networks in Slovenia: A blessing or a curse?

There is no clear legal Definition of corruption in New Zealand. There is a rather diffuse institutional policing of whatever is considered to be corruption, an apparent growth of organised crime, and sometimes public controversy surrounding conflicts of interests in public procurement. Some concerns have been raised about the sale of state assets in the 1980s and 1990s. There is also occasionally evidence of corruption in high public offices and with the parliament’s tardiness in ratifying the United Nations Convention against Corruption. TI-New Zealand has recently commented that the country’s consistently high ranking on the CPI may actually discourage closer examination of these and other issues. Against this background, and with some comparative reference to Hong Kong and mainland China, this article seeks to move towards a framework for future research on corruption in New Zealand. © Copyright 2012 Taylor and Francis Group LLC.;;;"Bailey, J., Corruption and Democratic Governability (2009) Corruption and Democracy in Latin America, , Charles H.

This is an analysis of changes in contracts that were concluded on the basis of the law on public procurement. While the pre-contractual phase is treated by law, in the post-contractual phase we can identify something like ""a legal vacuum'', which can be exploited to corrupt practices. Article examines how important (particularly in terms of impact on the price) are changes in the contracts concluded under the law on public contracts and whether it is possible to identify some factors which affect this behaviour. The regression analysis showed that the prices ex-post rise more if the open procedure was used as well as if there was strong competition on the supply side (In these cases, it is more difficult to ex-ante manipulate with the outcome of the public contract).

It explores risk factors of corruption in relation to the roles of government, agent, and briber. The Anti-corruption potential of public e-procurement includes the reduction in monopoly of power, information asymmetry, corruption fees, and corruption services. In the paper we also discuss case study examples from Denmark, Singapore, the Republic of Korea, and the Government of Andhra Pradesh in India. These indicate the potential of e-procurement for greater transparency and efficiency. The discussions suggest that the anti-corruption capabilities of public e-procurement have many benefits, particularly, in terms of enhancing accountability, effectiveness and transparency in government procurement, to combat corruption.

We show that before the reform, manufacturing firms with government stakes, old firms and larger firms had advantages in access to government orders. In 2009 large firms retain their advantages in access to government orders. Estimated scales of 'kickback' in 2009 were virtually the same as in 2005. Active restructuring of the enterprises had no infl uence on the enterprises' access to government orders. We discuss the reasons for this failure of the radical reform of public procurement in Russia, and provide some policy implications.

These characteristics are compared for two groups of public procurement contract winners that differ by their ownership structure. The detailed data from the Czech Republic are used and the firms with bearer shares in paper form serve as the less transparent firms. The results show that less transparent firms have significantly higher profit margins in terms of tens of percentage points and participate in less competitive public procurement contracts and result into lower savings for the public authority. This could be an indirect indicator of conflict of interests or corruption.

The aim of this paper is to examine the level of transparency in the EU directives for public works contracts 2004/18/EC. The study is carried out through a literature review, a content analysis of the Directive 2004/18/EC and a few case laws from European Court of Justice (ECJ). The types of enforcements allowed for by the Directive and those used by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) are also examined. The paper concludes that there are a number of articles that encourage transparency and those that impede transparency through legal restrictions/exclusions. The directive addressed the procurement procedure superficially which leads to a raft of problems in implementation stage. The research is limited to Directive 2004/18/EC. The paper will increase client's awareness on transparency and some problems associated with implementation stage through case laws.

Because corrupt practices mostly occur under wraps, the task of combating corruption becomes even more difficult. In the course of a review of the extant literature on the theme a number of independent constructs with the potential to develop anti-corruption strategies have been identified. A research model was developed on the basis of the hypothesis that anti-corruption strategies lead to corruption free performance in public construction projects. A questionnaire survey was administered and 105 responses were collected. 'Anti-corruption strategies' was defined as a second order construct composed of four latent constructs: leadership, rules and regulations, training and fear of punishment. The structural equation modelling (SEM) technique was used to test the hypothesized positive inter-relations between anti-corruption strategies and corruption free performance. The significance of the role of management leadership, rules and regulations, training, as well as fear of punishment is highlighted to help policy makers and construction institutions in understanding the role of various anti-corruption strategies in public construction projects so that they may contribute to this important endeavour in achieving the goal of promoting economy, efficiency, quality, fairness and transparency. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.;Anti-corruption, corruption, India, public construction projects;"Anti-corruption; corruption; India; Policy makers; Public construction projects; Public procurement; Questionnaire surveys; Research models; Rules and regulations; Second-order constructs; Structural equation modelling; Construction industry; Crime; construction; corruption; development project; institutional framework; modeling; performance assessment; policy making; project management; public sector; questionnaire survey; research; India";"Amaratunga, D., Baldry, D., Sarshar, M., Performance evaluation in facilities management: using the balanced scorecard approach (2000) Proceedings from COBRA 2000 RICS (Construction and Building Research Conference), pp. 1-16. , Royal Navy College, University of Greenwich, UK; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modeling in practice. a review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Ashforth, B.E., Anand, V., The normalization of corruption in organizations (2003) Research in Organizational Behavior, 25, pp. 1-52; (2006) Curbing corruption in public procurement in Asia and the Pacific Manila: Asian Development Bank, , http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Public-Procurement-Asia-Pacific/public-procurement.pdf, Asian Development Bank/OECD, available at (accessed 24 May 2008); Bass, B., (1990) Bass & Stogdill's Handbook of Leadership: Theory, Research, and Managerial Applications, , New York: Free Press; Bentler, P.M., Yuan, K.H., Structural equation modeling with small samples: test statistics (1999) Multivariate Behavioral Research, 34 (2), pp. 181-197; Byrne, B.M., (1998) Structural Equation Modelling with LISREL, PRELIS and SIMPLIS: Basic Concepts, Applications and programming, , Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum; Calhoun, C.H., Wolitzer, P., Ethics as a value added service (2001) The CPA Journal, 71 (1), pp. 71-73; Cavill, S., Sohail, M., (2007) Accountability Arrangement to Combat Corruption: Literature Review, , Loughborough, UK: WEDC; Charan, R., Ending the CEO succession crisis (2005) Harvard Business Review, 83 (2), pp. 4-13; Chinda, T., Mohammad, S., Structural equation model of construction safety culture (2008) Engineering Construction and Architectural Management, 15 (2), pp. 114-131; Dininio, P., Kpundeh, S.J., Leiken, R., (1998) USAID Handbook for Fighting Corruption, Center for Democracy and Governance, US Agency for International Development, , Washington, DC; Doig, A., Riley, S., Corruption and anti-corruption strategies: issues and case studies from developing countries (1998) Corruption and Integrity Improvement Initiatives in Developing Countries, pp. 45-62. , In: UNDP, editors New York: United Nation Development Program; Dunn, S.C., Seaker, R.F., Waller, M.A., Latent variables in business logistics research: scale development and validation (1994) Journal of Business Logistics, 15 (2), pp. 145-172; Evans, J.M., Treviño, L.K., Weaver, G.R., Who's in the ethics driver's seat?

Design/methodology/approach: Interviews were conducted over a nine-month period in 2007 to gauge the perception of the procurement officers and contractors on procurement issues in Malaysia. The interview data were then transcribed and grouped according to six main themes; transparency, procurement policies and procedures and its implementation, personnel involved in the procurement system, estimation/budget/pricing, professionalism and ethics and timeliness. Findings: One of the common complaints made by the contractors was prevalence of interference from outside parties and cronyism, which affects the awarding of contracts. The procurement officers were blamed for malpractice and non-compliance to the policies and procedures of the procurement system. Practical implications: The paper deals with sensitive issues and takes several months to successfully gather respondents who willing to give feedback on their experience with the procurement system. The data are first hand information and are carefully transcribed and categorized into categories to help better understanding of the issues raised by the respondents. Originality/value: The paper deals with sensitive issues and takes several months to successfully gather respondents who willing to give feedback on their experience with the procurement system.

At the beginning of the paper the correlation between public investment and corruption in the EU countries is observed. Then the case of Croatia is analyzed, where quality of infrastructure, size of capital public expenditure, irregularities in public procurement, role of government in the construction sector, and effects of political corruption on public capital projects are considered. The paper shows that countries with high public investment have bigger (political) corruption. Despite the high share of public capital expenditure in GDP, Croatia's infrastructure is in a bad state. Judging by the size and the structure of public investment, as well as weak control mechanisms, there are plenty of opportunities for political corruption in Croatian public capital projects, for which there are strong indications that they are being used. Instead of investing in new, highly visible projects, policy makers should direct more attention and money towards maintaining and improving the existing infrastructure, because in Croatia billions of kunas are flowing away. Focusing on fighting political corruption would have significant effects on budget expenditure rationalization and economic growth.;Corruption, Croatia, Infrastructure, Public investment;;"Badun, M., Decentralizacija, korupcija i nadzor lokalnih proračuna u Hrvatskoj (2009) Newsletter, p. 38. , Institut za javne financije; Bajo, A., Filipović, B., Učinkovitost opskrbe vodom u Hrvatskoj (2008) Newsletter, p. 37. , Institut za javne financije; de la Croix, D., Delavallade, C., Growth, Public Investment and Corruption with Failing Institutions (2009) Economics of Governance, 10 (3), pp. 187-219. , doi:10.1007/313 s10101-008-0057-4; (2008) Izvješće O Radu Državne Komisije Za Kontrolu Postupaka Javne Nabave Za 2007, , http://www.dkom.hr/onama/GodisnjeIzvjesce2007.pdf, DKOM, (21. 6. 2009.); (2009) Izvješće O Radu Državnih Odvjetništava U 2008.

Less is known about the perceptions and personal experiences of those working in civil society in this regard. This article explores (i) general perceptions of the use of contacts; (ii) personal experience with contacts both as 'users' and 'go-betweens'; and (iii) the maintenance of personal and/or work-related contacts-drawing on large-scale qualitative and quantitative data collected among NGO representatives in east central Europe, southeast Europe and the West Balkans. It is argued that contacts are indeed widely used by NGO representatives. The article is rounded off by a discussion of civil society's ability to perform the role of anti-corruption watchdog, given that contacts are widely used also in this sector. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.";Informal practice, NGOs, Post-communism, Watchdog;;"Chavdarova, T., Business relations as trusting relations: The case of Bulgarian small business (2007) Soziale Netzwerke und soziales Vertrauen in den Transformationsländern, pp. 277-302. , in: K.

The resulting model is a bidimensional triangular dynamic system able to generate endogenous fluctuations for certain values of some relevant parameters. We study the model from the analytical point of view and find that multiple equilibria with nonconnected basins are likely to emerge. We also perform a stability analysis and prove the existence of a compact global attractor. Finally, we focus on local and global bifurcations causing the transition to more and more complex asymptotic dynamics. In particular, as our map is nondifferentiable in a subset of the states space, we show that border collision bifurcations occur. Several numerical simulations support the analysis. Our study aims at demonstrating that no long-run equilibria with zero corruption exist and, furthermore, that periodic or aperiodic fluctuations in economic growth are likely to emerge. As a consequence, the economic system may be unpredictable or structurally unstable.

By performing public procurement the state directly participates on the market and its behaviour influences the whole economic flows. Actually, through public procurement the state should clearly show that it respects the basic principles of market economy, and performs well the justified function of the guarantor of undisturbed functioning of free and fair competition. In order to regulate the process of using public assets by a certain public institution, in order to gain access to external resources and also taking into consideration its commitment to full membership of the European Union, the Republic of Macedonia has adopted a modern Public Procurement Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2008, and which is almost entirely aligned with the relevant European legislation and regulations which directly regulate this area. However, in spite of that, the adopted legislation framework has not led to overcoming of; but on the contrary, it has continued to produce numerous inconsistencies in the sphere of public procurement and in the successful application of the system. The authors of this paper give an overall view of the data related to the implementation of the Public Procurement Act gained from the monitoring of the public procurement process in the Republic of Macedonia as presented in the Second quarterly report from June 2009, which stresses the so-called declarative efforts in the prevention of abuse in the field of public procurement. However, this has not led to the expected results, having in mind the fact that there are still numerous inconsistencies on the institutional level which make it impossible to successfully implement the legal solutions. Notably, the emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of legal protection from various abuses in the sphere of public procurement, which has been shown as quite convenient for engaging in different deviant behaviours presented through numerous acts of corruption. In this respect, special attention should be put on the aspects of criminal law which are indirectly involved in this area, simultaneously pointing to the solutions accepted by the amended criminal legislation in Macedonia, including those envisaged in the legislation of the Republic of Croatia.";Legal protection, Market economy, Public procurement;;"Russian source; Russian source; Russian source; Russian source; Russian source; Russian source; Russian source; Russian source; Russian source; Russian source; Russian source; Olejarz, M., Paista, D., (2009) Priručnik o pravnoj zaštiti u postupcima javne nabave za ponuditelje, , note; Russian source; Russian source; Russian source; Novoselec, P., (2007) Aktualni problemi hrvatskog gospodarskog kaznenog prava, 14, pp. 371-434. , note; Russian source; Russian source; Russian source; Novoselec, P., (2007) Aktualni problemi hrvatskog gospodarskog kaznenog prava, 14, pp. 371-434. , note; Russian source";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-79959662814

There is a growing need for procurement systems to be able to fight corruption and improve the effectiveness, efficiency, fairness and transparency of public procurement. A comprehensive list of irregularities in public procurement is derived from irregularities observed during technical vigilance inspections by experts and reported cases. The research involved a questionnaire survey, Delphi method and an empirical investigation of the dynamics of irregular practices in public procurement. The survey revealed the top 15 most frequent irregularities. The irregularities have been classified under five categories: transparency, professional standards, fairness, contract monitoring and regulation and procedural irregularities. The ranking of these categories reveals that transparency is the key factor requiring prime attention. The other categories are of nearly equal importance. A framework for good procurement is developed and actions proposed under five categories to curb corruption in public procurement. The framework and the irregularities can be related systematically to various aspects of combating corruption, and hence should fulfil the urgent need of policy- makers, professional staff, regulators and consumers. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.;Corruption, India, Irregularities, Public sector procurement;"Construction markets; Corruption; Delphi method; Empirical investigation; India; Irregularities; Key factors; Policy makers; Professional standards; Public procurement; Public sector procurement; Questionnaire surveys; Professional aspects; Surveys; Transparency; Crime; construction industry; corruption; Delphi analysis; efficiency measurement; public administration; public sector; questionnaire survey; India";"Abed, G.T., Gupta, S., (2002) Governance, Corruption, and Economic Performance, , International Monetary Fund, Washington, DC; Arrowsmith, S., Hartley, K., Introduction (2000) Public Procurement, 1, pp. 9-27. , in Arrowsmith, S. and Hartley, K.

The analysis reported here describes the specific problems associated with affirming institutional integrity in the field of public procurement, which constitutes a 'tough test'. Public procurement is namely an area where the acquis swiftly gained pre-eminence in accession states, but whose complex regulations depend on a well-functioning judiciary, effective administrative supervision and limited corruption. The experience in Poland and Bulgaria, countries that represent different stages of institution building in this area, is compared. The results suggest that an EU-compatible public procurement regime is being consolidated throughout the CEE region. At the same time, that regime may only work well when boundaries between institutional subjects, as well as between the spheres of law, politics and economics, are upheld in post-communist countries. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;;;"EU Commission, Public Procurement, available at; Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), 'Executive Summary', in Fighting Corruption and Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement (OECD Publishing, 2005), at 9; Trepte, P., Regulating Procurement: Understanding the Ends and Means of Public Procurement Regulation (Oxford University Press, 2004), at 98; Notably, Bulgaria and Romania joined two years and seven months later than the previous seven CEE countries; Lazowski, A., 'Public Procurement', in A.

Crabtree (eds), Doing Qualitative Research (Sage, 1999), at 71-88; In a first set of interviews, the mere hint at the issue of corruption turned out to be so disturbing to some informants that it subsequently had to be rephrased and toned down, so as not to distort or 'cloud' responses to the remaining questions. One interpretation of this observation might be that corruption is very widespread in both countries. After closer examination of the entire interviews, however, the interpretation evolved that in most cases procurement officials have simply become highly sensitised to the issue, to the extent that a positive professional identification hinges on internalising an anti-corruption agenda; Here I wish to acknowledge the splendid field work conducted by Paulina Polak and Bistra Nikolova, who respectively conducted the Polish and Bulgarian sets of interviews. Thirty semi-structured, in-depth interviews per country were carried out October 2005-March 2006.

These two challenges sometimes merge, for example where public officials are paid to turn a blind eye to collusive tendering schemes or to release information that facilitates collusion (e.g. the universe of potential bidders or the bids themselves). However, analytically, preventing corruption on the part of public officials and promoting effective competition between potential suppliers are separable challenges: the former (corruption) is first and foremost a principal-agent problem in which the official (i.e. the “agent’) enriches himself at the expense of the government or the public (i.e. the “principal’); while the latter (promoting competition) involves preventing collusive practices among potential suppliers and removing barriers that unnecessarily impede healthy competition. The issue of ensuring integrity in public procurement processes has rightly received a good deal of attention at the international level in recent years. It is addressed by various international instruments, including: (i) the UN Convention Against Bribery and Corruption; (ii) the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions; and (iii) the OECD Revised Recommendation on Combating Bribery in International Business Transactions. © Worlds Trade Organization 2011.";;;"Jenny, F., Competition and Anti-Corruption Considerations in Public Procurement (2005) Fighting Corruption and Promoting Integrity in Public Procurement, pp. 29-35; Schooner, S.L., Desiderata: Objectives for a System of Government Contract Law (2002) Public Procurement Law Review, , http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstractid=304620; Arrowsmith, S., (2003) Government Procurement in the WTO, pp. 169-171; How do you define corruption, , www.transparency.org/newsroom/faq/corruption_faq; Harms, B.C., holding public officials accountable in the international realm (2000) Cornell International Law Journal, 33, p. 159; Wade, R., the system of administrative and politicalcorruption:Canal irrigationin south india (2003) Governing the Market: Economic Theory and the Role of Government in East Asian Industrialization; Krueger, A.O., The Political Economy of the Rent-seeking Society (1974) American Economic Review, 64, p. 291; (2009) OECD Principles for Integrity in Public Procurement, , www.oecd.org/document/25/0,3343,en26493413542768665_1_1_1_1,00.html; (1998) To Promote Innovation: The Proper Balance Ofcompetition, , SeeUSFederalTradeCommission, Calgary: University of, Calgary Press for the Industry Canada Research Series; Carlton, D.W., Perloff, J.M., (2004) Modern Industrial Organization, , New York: Addison-Wesley; Milgrom, P., Auctions and Bidding: A Primer (1989) Journal of Economic Perspectives, 3, p. 3; Burt, D.N., Pinkerton, R.L., (2006) A Purchasing Manager’s Guide to Strategic, Proactive Procurement; Evenett, S.J., Evenett, B., International Co-operation and the Reformof Public ProcurementPolicies, , http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstractid=821424,2004; Stigler, G.J., A Theory of Oligopoly (1964) Journal of Political Economy, 72, p. 44; Tirole, J., (1988) The Theory of Industrial Organization, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Coate, M.B., Techniques for Protecting Against Collusion in Sealed Bid Markets (1985) Antitrust Bulletin, 30, pp. 899-990; Porter, R.H., Zona, J.D., Detection of Bid Rigging in Procurement Auctions (1993) Journal of Political Economy, 101, p. 518; Kovacic, W.E., The Civil False Claims Act as a Deterrent to Participation in Public Procurement Markets (1998) Supreme Court Economic Law Review, 6, p. 201; Cibinic Jr, J., Nash Jr, R.C., (1998) Formation of Government Contracts, pp. 522-525; Nicholas, C., Framework Agreements and the UNCITRAL Model Law on Procurement (2008) Public Procurement Law Review, 17";Book Chapter;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84927627188

Using survey data and bottom-up estimate of the cost of corruption, it finds that Bulgaria's accession to the EU marked a shift of corruption upwards from the middle (expert) to the high (political) level of public management with better structured political-business networks and increased cost to society. At the same time control is moving to lower value contracts. In this context the article discusses the limitations of procurement regulations to deter grand corruption and draws attention to checks and balances in the political setting, which shapes the public- private interface. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.;Bulgaria, Corruption, Public procurement;;"Anderson, J.H., Gray, C.W., (2006) Anti-Corruption In Transition 3: Who is Succeeding ... and Why?, , Washington, DC: World Bank; Anechiarico, F., Jacobs, J.B., (1995) Purging Corruption from Public Contracting: The 'Solutions' Are Now Part of the Problem, 40, pp. p143. , New York Law School Law Review; Anechiarico, F., Jacobs, J.B., (1996) The Pursuit of Absolute Integrity: How Corruption Control Makes Government Ineffective, , Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press; (2005) Monitoring of Public Procurement: Most Common Violations and Corrupt Practices, , Bulgarian Industrial Association, Bulgarian source, Sofia: Bulgarian Industrial Association; Celentani, M., Ganuza, J.-J., (2001) Organized Vs.

Two decades on, most of the optimism has died out and post-communist countries of Eastern Europe are struggling with more than just the regime's legacy. Corruption is one of the key issues that the countries of Western Balkans need to overcome in order to part from the past. Much investment has been made in fighting corruption, through a variety of tools: from providing legal structure to empowering citizen groups. Using Alina Mungiu-Pippidi's corruption typology, I made a corruption diagnosis by looking at state capture, public procurement, privatization and people's perception and experience of corruption in Albania, Kosovo and Serbia. The conclusion is that they fall into a competitive particularistic system, characterized by unfair and unpredictable distribution of goods, and high state capture. The focus of this paper is on civil society activities, which covers the role of the media. I compared the experiences of Albania, Kosovo and Serbia, on three levels: civil society, sector-specific and project-specific. Civil society as a whole is compared using USAID score on NGO sustainability and the Freedom House civil society score. In comparing the sectors, I have used the sector-specific impact assessment model developed by Helmut Anheier. Finally, I compare individual projects to find elements which make successful civil society projects. The evidence suggests that civil society in these countries is weak, fragmented and under financial pressure. In the anti-corruption sector, across the four impact assessment dimensions (legal impact, media coverage, public awareness, and expert opinion) civil society has contributed, though to a limited extent. In terms of individual projects, there have been a number of success stories, but most of the success stories aim government transparency. More attention needs to be paid to political corruption, where political parties are generally considered to be at the core of high level corruption. I also looked into investigative reporting as a powerful tool of naming and shaming. Shows with investigative reporting enjoy high popularity. However, reporters face a multitude of dangers and threats from various fractions of the society. One thing is clear, the Western Balkan states will have to deal with their high levels of corruption before they can join the EU and civil society should have a role in that, as it would have in a functional democracy.;;;"Aleksi, I., Privatisation and Various Structural Reforms in Albania, , (kein Datum).

Namely, it contributes to the investigation of a model of the evolution of corruption in public procurement proposed by Brianzoni et al. [4]. Bifurcation structure of the economically meaningful part of the parameter space is described, in particular, the fold and flip border-collision bifurcation curves of the superstable cycles are obtained.

The purpose of this paper is to explore and discuss corruption practices inherent in public procurement of infrastructural projects in Ghana with the aim of identifying corruption related challenges that must be addressed in order to actualize the expected economic gains of infrastructural projects. Design/methodology/approachDrawing extensively on existing literature and published data, the methodology adopted for the paper consisted of multi-stage critical review of pertinent literature; review of 2007 Annual Report of the Public Procurement Authority and review of the Public Procurement Act, 2003 (Act 663). The study assumes value-laden axiological philosophy, where the values and experiences of the authors provided the basis for the discussion. FindingsConflict of interest, bribery, embezzlement, kickbacks, tender manipulation and fraud are observed corruption practices in the Ghanaian infrastructure projects delivery system. The severity of corruption practices have intensified the search for more innovative means of delivering infrastructure projects that will achieve value for money. In the pursuit to control corruption practices, this would require constitution of a sound procurement system and pro-social equity policies that would foster good governance, corporate social responsibility, transparency, accountability, judicious public expenditure and national progress. The Public Procurement Act 2003 (Act 663) is observed to proffer solutions for these underlying constructs but not without challenges. Research limitations/implicationsThe nature of the research is review and explanatory without any empirical analysis to support the discussions and thus the results cannot be generalized on a broader context of public procurement practice in Ghana. Practical implicationsImplementation of sound procurement performance measurements would be imperative in the bid to curb corruption practices. The paper suggested a number of business approaches to combat corrupt practices in Ghana, which are explained in terms of political, psychological, technical, operational and retaliatory measures. In this paper, it is proposed that knowledge about and debating corruption related issues is just as important to the modern public procurement as are the abilities to creatively and logically introduce monitoring systems when planning, executing and completing projects. Originality/valueThe work is novel providing meaningful insights into conceptual basis for a detailed empirical analysis. Being a pioneering study, further research tailored to compare the extent of corruption practices in various sectors of the economy of Ghana would be novel. © 2010, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";Corruption, Ghana, Public procurement;;"Abbey, J.L.S., (2005) The growth and corruption correlation: its impact on the achievement of middle income status, , (), “”, report prepared by Centre for Policy Analysis in Collaboration with The World Bank Ghana Office,Ghana Anti Corruption Coalition, National Governance Programme, Ghana Integrity Initiative, Accra:;

It explores the extent to which institutional and management systems could be the determinants of the increasing unethical behaviour in local government procurement systems in Kibaale District, Uganda. The results are from a cross-sectional descriptive study design that attracted a total of 77 respondents out of the sampled 86 (a response rate of 89.5%). The reliability analysis of the results was found to be with an alpha = 0.804. Descriptive and relational statistics were used to analyse the data obtained from a closed five-Likert-scale questionnaire. The findings overall do not show a very strong relationship between institutional frameworks and management systems as key determinants of unethical behaviour, suggesting the presence of other possible determinants. However, the results indicate that there are two specific variables under management (communication and monitoring and evaluation) that have a statistically significant correlation with unethical behaviour in procurement. We compare the results with existing literature and suggest practical and policy implications.

Typically these weights are fixed and subjectively set in advance. Methods, which objectively determine the weights after the opening of the sealed bids on the basis of the most or least favorable weights for each proposal, are developed. Post-objective methods of weight determination are shown to enhance the integrity of the evaluation process and to limit corruption in a public tender. The connection of Data Envelopment Analysis, which has been extensively applied to measure supplier efficiency, with the developed methods, is explored. Average least and most favorable weights are derived and optimal bidding strategies in this setting are presented. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The former patrimonial frameworks and patterns have worn out while global power and increasing disparities overwhelm traditional systems of patronage. Plamen K. Georgiev discusses the controversial issues of endemic corruption, state capture, institutional fraud, and networks of organized crime in South East Europe and in a wider global context. He traces back types of patronage and patron-client relations through the ages up to modernity. The author critically comments on shifts of loyalties, friendship, nepotism as well as on deficits of constitutional and public procurement in the context of ""quasi- democracies"" on the Balkans. His analysis is based on empirical findings and sociological observations made during the past seven years. Finally, the author presents valuable methodological suggestions for innovative interdisciplinary research in this field. © VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften | GWV Fachverlage GmbH, Wiesbaden 2008.

Morocco launched an Internet portal in 2008 making public procurement rules, regulations and opportunities easily accessible to the general public. A new Central High Tender Board was formed in Yemen to ensure that the rules for public procurement are respected, and that the remedies are applied if the rules were broken or ignored. The Iraqi government has asked the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to examine its public procurement regulations and procedures and offer suggestions on how to improve them. The analysts measured the country's policies against international legal instruments and best practices, and suggested corrective measures. The governments under MENA region have agreed on the need to involve all stakeholders in preventing corruption, and applying measures to improve government integrity.;;"corruption; government; Internet; OECD; policy implementation; stakeholder; Middle East; Morocco; North Africa";"Business Ethics and Anti-bribery Policies in Selected Middle East and North African countries, , MENA-OECD Investment Programme, MENA task force on business integrity and combating bribery of public officials; (2009) Improving Transparency Within Government Procurement Procedures in Iraq: OECD Benchmark Report, , OECD, October; Transparency International (2009) Global Corruption Report, p. 191. , Cambridge, and 196; www.oecd.org/gov/ethics/jls, Visit";Article;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-73349123784

The development of public-private partnerships throughout the world is a good illustration of this trend. In order to foster competition, competitive tendering through the use of auctions is now common. Nevertheless, competition for the field must be organized. Depending on the rules of the game chosen, introducing competition for the field may or may not be successful. In this paper we investigate two alternative models for organizing local public services, namely the French and the London models of urban public transport. Few competitors and collusive behaviours, with increasing costs, characterize the French model, while the London model, as far as we have seen, exhibits better results, by using the transparency of auction procedures and the discretionary power of the regulator as two complementary instruments to foster competition and prevent anti-competitive behaviours.

In the ancient Greek and Roman Empires, corruption was reportedly widespread and deplored by the thinkers of that time as much as it is today. In the fourteenth century, Abdul Rahman Ibn Khaldun located the root cause of corruption in the desire by the ruling class to live in luxury. Writing about seventeenth-century England, Linda Peck gives a detailed account of monarchical and bureaucratic corruption. In the early twentieth century, Lord Bryce recorded the prevalence of corruption in America and its transfer to post-First World War Europe. The literature on corruption is extensive, and there is no shortage of material on the history, nature, effects and consequences of corruption. Like most social issues, corruption can be defined in any number of ways, to cover a range of behaviours from ‘venality to ideological erosion’. A wide definition of corruption will take account of its operation in both public and private sectors, and may extend to cover activities that strictly speaking consist of fraud, extortion, embezzlement and abuse of office. However, this chapter will focus on bureaucratic corruption, which includes bribery, kickbacks, ‘gifts’ and illicit payments to government officials in their capacity as public servants, in order for the giving party to achieve a stated purpose. © Cambridge University Press 2013.;;;"Hamilton, E., Cairns, H., (1961), New York: Pantheon, Book 12, section d; Macmullen, R., (1988) Corruption and the Decline of Rome, , NewHaven, CT: Yale University Press; Jacoby, N., Nehemkis, P., Eells, R., (1977) Bribery and Extortion in World Business: A Study of Corporate Political Payments Abroad, pp. 7-43. , London: Macmillan Publishing; Atlas, S.H., (1980) The Sociology of Corruption: The Nature, Function, Causes and Prevention of Corruption, pp. 9-77. , Singapore: Times Books; Peck, L.L., (1990) Court Patronage Andcorruption in Early Stuart England, , London: Routledge; Bryce, J., (1921) Modern Democracies, 2, 509p. , New York: Macmillan Publishing; Nye, J.S., Corruption and Political Development: A Cost–Benefit Analysis (1967) American Political Science Review, pp. 417-419; Wilson, J., Corruption Is Not Always Scandalous (1968) Theft of the City: Readings on Corruption in America, 29p. , J.

Corruption continues to be a usual suspect among the factors that distort the effective delivery of public services in developing countries and at no time can it be described as a 'gift' to development. In Africa, corruption remains an important obstacle to political and economic development (Mbaku, 2008). While the negative effects of corruption speak 'volumes of words', limited empirical research on public procurement corruption and its effects on service delivery have been conducted in Uganda. This study was conducted partly to fill up this knowledge vacuum. The paper presents the results from 548 respondents on their perceived forms of procurement corruption and discusses the effects of this corruption on service delivery. The results are compared with local and international literature and policy-managerial implications are suggested. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.;Corruption, Public procurement, Public services, Service delivery;;"Alt, J.E., Lassen, D.D., The political economy of institutions and corruption in American States (2003) Journal of Theoretical Politics, 15 (3), pp. 341-365; Amundsen, I., (1999) Political Corruption: An Introduction to the Issues, , Working Paper 7, Chr.

Procurement is thus a multi-dimensional bidding contest with one-dimensional type space (the privately known cost). The optimal price and bribe bid is derived based on an iid private cost assumption. In the experiment, bribes are negatively framed to capture that society is better off if bribes are rare or low. Although bid prices are lower than predicted, behavior is qualitatively in line with the linear equilibrium prediction. When bribes generate a negative externality, there is a significant increase in the variability of the data.;Corruption, Procurement auctions;;"Abbink, K., Rose-Ackerman, S., Laboratory experiments on corruption (2006) International Handbook on the Economics of Corruption, pp. 418-439. , Edward Elgar Cheltenham; Arozamena, L., Weinschelbaum, F., (2004) The Effect of Corruption on Bidding Behavior in First-price Auctions, , Discussion paper, Universidad de San Andrés; Beck, P.J., Maher, M.W., A comparison of bribery and bidding in thin markets (1986) Economics Letters, 20, pp. 1-5; Burguet, R., Che, Y.K., Competitive procurement with corruption (2004) Rand Journal of Economics, 35, pp. 50-68; Che, Y.K., Design competition through multidimensional auctions (1993) Rand Journal of Economics, 24, pp. 668-680; Compte, O., Lambert-Mogiliansky, A., Verdier, T., Corruption and competition in procurement (2005) Rand Journal of Economics, 36, pp. 1-15; Duggan, M., Levitt, S.D., Winning isn't everything: Corruption in sumo wrestling (2002) American Economic Review, 92, pp. 1594-1605. , 5; Kagel, J.H., Kagel, J., Roth, A.E., Auctions: A survey of experimental research (1995) Handbook of Experimental Economics, pp. 501-585. , Princeton University Press Princeton; Karahan, G.R., Razzolini, L., Shughart Ii, W.F., Centralized versus decentralized decision-making in a county government setting (2002) Economics of Governance, 3, pp. 101-115; Lengwiler, Y., Wolfstetter, E., Dimitri, N., Piga, G., Spagnolo, G., Corruption in procurement auctions (2006) Handbook of Procurement, pp. 412-429. , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Lien, D.D., A note on competitive bribery games (1986) Economics Letters, 22, pp. 337-341; (2007) Bribery in Public Procurement: Methods, Actors and Counter-measures, , OECD OECD Publishing; Rose-Ackerman, S., (1999) Corruption and Government: Causes, Consequences, and Reform, , Cambridge University Press Cambridge; Selten, R., Stoecker, R., End behavior in sequences of finite prisoner's dilemma supergames (1986) Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 7, pp. 47-70. , 1; (2007) The 2007 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, , http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi, Transparency International Retrieved January 31, 2008";Article;Final;All Open Access, Bronze, Green;Scopus;2-s2.0-50249164769

The focus is on specific European legislation – Procurement Directive 2004/18 on the coordination of procedures for the award of contracts for public works, public supply and public services by public bodies within all EU Member States – however similar issues would arise in other jurisdictions. Design/methodology/approach The procurement process is examined in relation to three stages of procedure: preparation of specifications, selection of tenderers, and execution of contracts, within each of which some specific risks (red flags) are identified. Findings Particular risks that may not have been sufficiently addressed, in terms of research or legislation, arise at the first of these stages; accordingly this paper focuses there. Generally, risks are summarised in terms of insiderdriven specifications, low visibility of procurement processes, and ample opportunities for renegotiation of terms. Risks may be increased by innovative procurement practices that have the effect of extending the manoeuvring between tenderers and public bodies, such as competitive dialogue. Research limitations/implications Fraud and corruption risk in public procurement is an area deserving detailed and comparative study, with special attention to the precontracting stage. Research on this topic within EU Member States should go hand in hand with enquiry into international procurement, and into the EC's own rules as applied by its institutions and bodies. Practical implications Suggestions for riskreduction are put forward in relation to quality standards and preaward publicity.

Greater collaboration across countries is now needed in order to draw real benefits from legal reforms. This report, commissioned by the Norwegian Ministry of Foriegn Affairs, is a step in that direction as it examines the potential for collaboration on anti-corruption issues between two countries. The focus is on corruption in the business environment and the situations reported concern trade between Norway and Brazil, with focus on Norwegian presence in Brazil. Reccommendations for collaboration fight against corruption, a discuss on the efficiency of different anti-corruption initiatives, and a survey of the perspectives of some Norwegian and Brazilian firms. The areas of customs regulation and procedures, public procurement, legal cooperation, and academic collaboration are found to be particulary relevant for transnational anti-corruption collaboration. The main ambition of the report has been to stimulate further iniatitives and dialogue between Norway and Brazil, As well as cross-border anti-corruption efforts in general.;;;"Abbell, M., (2004) Obtaining evidence abroad in criminal cases, , New York; Aidt, T.S., Economic analysis of corruption: A survey (2003) The Economic Journal, 113, pp. 632-652; Andvig, J.C., Moene, K.O., How corruption may corrupt (1990) Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 13, pp. 63-76; Baracui, P.L., (2006) Estudo de conformidade do ambiente brasileiro com a Convȩnção Interamericana Contra a Corrupção da OEA, Transparência Brasil report; Barbosa, L., The Brazilian way: An Exercise in national identity (1995) The Brazilian Puzzle: Culture on the Borderlands of the Western World, , J.

White there are some indications that corruption may have become less rampant in recent years, available evidence suggests that corruption levels are still high, while trust in key istitutions is low. The impact on citizens is signicant: day-to-day corruption can put a substantial strain on the poorest and most marginalized groups, while frequent scandals involving corruption among highest public officials undermines people's, particularly young citizens', confidence in the future. Serbia is a country in transition. It is important to tackle corruptions systematically to avoid its becoming institutionalised. However, while good news and perceptions are thin on the ground, we find that the country is on a positive track in several areas: there are signs of greater control of public procurement, conflict of interest has begun to be regulated, access to information and transparency of the government institutions have improved significantly, and the capacity of enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute organised crime and corruption is increasing. The burden of rules and procedures has eased for private business, cutting opportunities for corruption. However, the political nature of the problem is constant, and more ambitious reforms are often effectively blocked by entrenched elites. A lasting impact on corruption levels cannot be achieved without sustained political will at the highest levels of government.;Corruption, Serbia;;;;;;;

The delays and costs that arise from this right to appeal are studied in the Swedish context with the aim of contributing to the debate on corruption in two ways. First, instead of using the modern definition of corruption, the ancient definition is introduced to explain anti-corruption efforts, focusing on corruption as deviations from a pristine standard as opposed to corruption as the abuse of public power for private gain. Second, it will be argued that the fight against corruption in the practical implementation of the European Act on Public Procurement jeopardizes efficiency and might devaluate competence. However, striving for the total elimination of corruption-an evil that has to be fought disregarding the consequences-is integral in the war against it. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.;Appeals, Corruption, Efficiency, The European Act on Public Procurement, Transparency;;"Ajayi, R., (2005) The House of Reps Crusade Against Corruption: Can the War Against Corruption Succeed, , http://www.vanguardngr.com/articles/2002/politics/p118012005-2.html, Vanguard Nigeria, 18 January; Andvig, J.C., Fjeldstad, O.H., Amundsen, I., Sissener, T., Soreide, T., (2000) Research on Corruption, A, , http://www.norad.no/ default.asp?V_ITEM_ID=1730, Policy Oriented Survey; Argandoña, A., Private-to-Private Corruption (2003) Journal of Business Ethics, 47 (13), pp. 253-267. , October, Kluwer Academic Publisher; Bratsis, P., The Construction of Corruption, or Rules of Separation and Illusions of Purity in Bourgeois Societies (2003) Social Text, 21 (4), pp. 9-33; City of Stockholm: 2005, Sammanfattning av Stockholmsförsöket, http://www.stockholm.se/templates/template_121.asp_Q_mainframe_E_templat e_117. asp?number=56099&category=12814; Crane, A., Matten, D., (2004) Business Ethics: A European Perspective: Managing Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability in the Age of Globalization, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Dagens Nyheter: 2005-03-02, Kammarrätten ger klartecken för vägtull, http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1298&a= 385609&previousRenderType=2; Dagens Nyheter: 2005-03-10, Dom om trängselskatt överklagad, http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1298&a=389200; Dagens Nyheter: 2005-03-11, Nytt bakslag omöjliggör höststart for trängselskatt, http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d= 554&a=389528; Donaldson, T.J., Dunfee, T.W., (1999) Ties that Bind: A Social Contracts Approach to Business Ethics, , Harvard Business School, Boston, Mass; Dunfee, T.W., Donaldson, T.J., Untangling the Corruption Knot: Global Bribery Viewed through the Lens of Integrative Social Contract Theory (2002) The Blackwell Guide to Business Ethics, pp. 61-76. , Blackwell Publishers, Oxford, pp; http://www.europa.eu.int/business/en/topics/ publicproc, EU Public Procurement; Everett, J., Neu, D., Rahaman, A.S., The Global Fight against Corruption: A Foucauldian, Virtue-Ethics Framing (2006) Journal of Business Ethics, 65, pp. 1-12; (2004), http://www.greco.coe.int/evaluations/cycle1/GrecoRC-I(2004) 14E-Hungary.pdf.pdf, GRECO; (2003), http://www.greco.coe.int/evaluations/cycle1/GrecoRC-I(2003) HE-Sweden.pdf, GRECO; Gould, D.J., Amaro-Reyes, J.A., (1983) The Effects of Corruption on Administrative Performance: Illustrations from Developing Countries, , The World bank, Washington; (2005) Corruption - Anthropological Perspectives, , Haller D. and C.

From road-building to high-tech communication infrastructure, public procurement averages 15% of GDP in OECD countries-substantially more in non-OECD economies-and it is a major factor in the world trade of goods and services. Given the growing complexity of bribe schemes in today's globalised markets, the problem is how to identify corruption in public procurement so governments can work toward effective prevention and apply sanctions if necessary. This report provides insights on all three fronts. Based on contributions from law enforcement and procurement specialists, the report describes how bribery is committed through the various stages of government purchasing; how bribery in public procurement is related to other crimes, such as fraud and money laundering; and how to prevent and sanction such crimes. The typical motivations and conduct of the various actors engaging in corruption are also highlighted, as well as ten case studies. © OECD 2007.";;;"Joly, E., (2003) Est-ce Dans Ce Monde-là Que Nous Voulons Vivre, p. 217. , Editions des Arènes; (2007) Integrity in Public Procurement: Good Practices from a to Z, , OECD";Book;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84957756144

An interesting feature of the system is that suppliers may be excluded from government contracts for breaches of procurement or anti-corruption legislation. This article critically examines corruption-related exclusions. It is suggested that there is likely to be a number of problems with the implementation of these exclusions. First, it is not clear how effective they will be in meeting the government's anti-corruption policy. Secondly, in respect of the exclusions imposed through a non-judicial process, there are no guidelines to ensure procedural safeguards, and furthermore, these exclusions may lead to delays and costs in the procurement process – especially when it comes to deciding whether persons or firms related to an excluded firm ought to be excluded. Thirdly, there are issues regarding proportionality of the measures. Fourthly, it may be difficult to maintain a consistent approach in deciding whether to exclude under the non-judicial exclusions. In view of these, for the regime to be effective, the South African government must be prepared to bear the attendant financial and procedural burden. © 2007, School of Oriental and African Studies.

The research scope was restricted to Directive 2004/18/EC adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 31 March 2004, which consolidates the previous directives in the same field. To this end, the research partners involved realised a survey of the literature, case study analysis and interviews, which highlighted the opportunities for economic/financial/organised crime inherent in specific items of EU public procurement legislation. Based on these inputs and sources, the researchers applied the CRAM to Directive 18/2004/EC and then developed a set of recommendations for better implementation of the methodology created in Project MARC. The exercise revealed some methodological difficulties with reference to the application of the CRAM in the pilot study. In particular, the following problematic aspects were revealed: the delta assessment (i.e. measurement of the differential in crime risk between the new and the old EU directives on procurement); the computational issues of the MARC formula (namely: elaboration of a synthetic Legislative Quality Index (LQI) and Market Vulnerability Index (MVI); reading LQI and MVI indicators not as separate entities but as linked together; risk that the same negative aspect of a legislative act may be double-counted under different indicators); the overlap between the MVI grids; and the content and wording of individual LQI/MVI indicators. The article concludes with a list of suggestions on how to repair these methodological shortcomings of the CRAM. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.";Corruption, Crime proofing, Crime risk assessment, European Union, Fraud, Money laundering, Organised crime, Pilot study, Public procurement law;;"Bovis, C., The new public procurement regime of the European Union: A critical analysis of policy, law and jurisprudence (2005) European Law Review, 30, pp. 607-630. , October; House, C., Still serious loopholes in ECGD's anti-corruption procedures (2005) Sturminster Newton, , 10, Devon: The Corner House, October; (2005) Commission staff working paper report on the public consultation on the Green Paper on Public-Private Partnerships and Community Law on Public Works and Concessions, , European Commission, Brussels, 3.5; Greco in Garofoli, R., Sandulli, M.A., (2005) Il nuovo diritto degli appalti pubblici, pp. 575-611. , Milano: Giuffrè; Zgagliardich, G., (1996) Subappalto e leggi antimafia nei lavori pubblici, pp. 1-11. , Milano: Giuffrè";Review;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-33947497019

Design/methodology/approach - A literature review resulted in a conceptual model and related hypotheses, pointing at four potential reasons for (non-)compliance: the purchaser's familiarity with the rules, the perceived inefficiency, organisational incentives to comply, and the expected resistance and readiness of suppliers to take action in case of non-compliance. The paper uses data from a survey among 147 responding purchasing professionals of the Dutch Ministry of Defence. Findings - The empirical findings indicate that both purchaser's familiarity with the rules and organisational incentives have a positive, statistically significant impact on compliance. Nor the alleged inefficiency of the directives, nor the expected supplier resistance seem to influence the compliance with the directives. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited in its setting: measuring perceptions of purchasing professionals within the Dutch Ministry of Defence. Future research could combine perceptual data and objective, measurable data on compliance. Future research might include other samples from other public agencies, questioning other respondents than purchasers, measuring factors from other fields and disciplines such as criminology (risk of detection and sanction risks), economy (costs and benefits), public choice theory (legitimacy), sociology (peer pressure), and social psychology (personal values). Practical implications - A managerial implication of the findings of this study would be that educating and training public purchasers will be an effective tool for increasing the compliance with the directives. In addition, public agencies could try to establish incentives in order to stimulate compliance. Originality/value - Although many studies have reported on the (limited) effectiveness of the EU tendering directives, little work has been undertaken on the compliance as such, while no empirical studies have been carried out to explain the (lack of) compliance with EU directives. This paper reports on a quantitative study, explaining the (non-) compliance with the directives. The study could be of value to public policy makers, to public agencies, and to researchers in the academic world.;Defence sector, European directives, European Union, Public procurement, Tendering, The Netherlands;"conceptual framework; European Union; organizational framework; planning practice; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; Western Europe";"Armstrong, J.S., Overton, T.S., ""Estimating non-response bias in mail surveys"" (1977) Journal of Marketing Research, 14 (8), pp. 396-402; (1993) Remedies for Enforcing the Public Procurement Rules, , Arrowsmith, S.

Experiences in curbing procurement corruption in Hungary, a former Eastern-block country which recently joined the EU, strengthens the view that by raising the level of evaluation practices through the use of decision support methodologies that can serve to narrow the possible damaging effects of corruption. This outcome may be achieved if legal regulations provide a supportive frame and organizational culture can be shaped to accommodate new decision practices. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The amendment was motivated, it seems, by a more majoritarian 'communitarian' legal philosophy seeking to strengthen political majorities. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.;;"legislation; political reform; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Southern Europe; World";"Alivizatos, N., 'A New Role for the Greek Church?'

Both policies have become prominent in international trade negotiations, including the Doha Round of World Trade Organization (WTO) trade talks. We show that fostering either domestic competition or transparency in state contracting tends to improve welfare. In contrast, we find no clear-cut effect on market access of ending discrimination or improving transparency. This mismatch between market access and welfare effects may account for the slower progress in negotiating procurement disciplines in trade agreements than for traditional border measures such as tariffs. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A critical threat to the attainment of these objectives is the presence of corruption. Bribery-induced violations of procurement procedures can be carried out in many different ways, but offences can still be categorised in two groups: i) Hidden violations of procurement rules - it looks as if the rules have been respected. ii) Legitimate deviations from procurement procedures - rules of exception (such as EU, 2004: Art. 30 and 31) are too frequently exploited. This chapter will concentrate mainly on the first category, discussing grey zones more than clear-cut bribery.1 First, some basics about the topic will be discussed. The problem with corruption is its tendency to replace public welfare as the fundamental concern in public institutions with the personal interest of employees. Corruption can thus be defined as the misuse of public office for private gain. The damage of this misuse lies in the influence on choices and the introduction of inefficiencies. Public expenditures increase as prices are inflated and not the main concern of the tender procedure. Also quality may yield to a bribe, perhaps resulting in the construction of buildings that are not earthquake-proof, the use of consultants unable to advise and roads not solid enough to bear the ordinary traffic. Moreover, corruption affects the allocation of public resources. Projects more likely to produce opportunities to obtain bribes are preferred; large construction projects are typically given priority over health and education projects. In countries where corruption is endemic, rent-seeking becomes a serious issue affecting most aspects of public life and undermining general confidence and respect for bureaucracy, politicians, formal laws and regulations. Corruption comes in the form of facilitation payments - inducements to get things done; and grand corruption - significant amounts offered to politicians or high-level officials capable of influencing large contracts. We draw a distinction between bureaucratic and political corruption, between active and passive bribery, and between public and private-private corruption. The critical importance of proof in cases of corruption compels us to use alternative terms when debating the issue, such as undue business practices, bid rigging, pre-selection or pre-determination of contracts, lowquality business climate, irregular trot, connections, extra legal activities, etc. Corruption is more common in some geographical areas than in others and more widespread in certain industries. Although the risk of corruption is present in many bureaucratic or governmental assignments, public procurement is probably the most exposed activity. This challenge was a main topic in a survey I conducted among Norwegian business leaders (Søreide, 2006) with helpful assistance from the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry (NHO). Eighty-two executives with significant experience from international trade responded to a questionnaire with close to 100 questions, all related to corruption. The survey also included interviews at high executive levels in several large firms. The study will be referred to throughout this chapter, with a focus on the responsibility of private firms. The less debated issue of accountability of public officials is nevertheless also essential. © OECD 2005.";;;"Bray, J., The use of intermediaries and other 'alternatives' to bribery (2005) The New Institutional Economics of Corruption, , J.G.

Discussions were structured around two major axes: mechanisms used to disguise corruption in public procurement and measures to prevent and detect corruption. An issues paper, prepared by Jean-Pierre Bueb of the French Central Service for the Prevention of Corruption, at the request of the OECD and in close collaboration with Nicola Ehlermann-Cache of the OECD's Anti-Corruption Division, details an array of these mechanisms and measures. This issues paper raised several questions for participants' consideration and provided a useful reference point for the discussions as well as the papers prepared for the workshop by panel speakers. All the papers submitted to participants are included in this part of this publication. Speakers from Argentina, Latvia, Mexico and Pakistan clearly illustrated a wide range of fraudulent and corrupt acts in public procurement and methods to hide these malpractices through national examples. Numerous contributions from other participants confirmed that these techniques to commit and disguise corruption are pervasive in countries around the world, and that they concern both developed and developing economies. Participants also raised a number of interesting aspects specific to international procurement as well as procurement in special circumstances (e.g. postconflict situations, massive privatisation) compared to local procurement. All stressed that the mechanisms described in the papers or mentioned during the discussion represent examples rather then an exhaustive inventory of the risks and mechanisms of corruption involved in public procurement. With a better understanding of the issues and difficulties collectively faced by governments, international organisations, multilateral development banks and NGOs, participants turned their attention to effective means to prevent and detect corruption in public procurement in the second part of the workshop. Informed by this thorough overview of national and international examples, discussions about the very nature of corruption and the fundamental purpose of the regulations that govern public procurement procedures led to a number of conclusions. Participants agreed on the need to redouble efforts to focus on corruption issues specific to public procurement. Specific needs included: • Identification of the mechanisms used to conceal corruption. • Improved mechanisms to share useful information (e.g. successful practices in fighting corruption, knowledge of cases or suspicions of corruption, identity of companies with a history of corruption) within and among government agencies; within and among international organisations; as well as across governments, international organisations and other stakeholders. • Development of an operational guide that describes in detail a wide range of measures for prevention, detection and sanction of corruption in international public procurement. • Specially conceived measures to address corruption in international procurement processes. © OECD 2005.";;;;Book Chapter;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84909356328

This quote is from William Shakespeare's Henry VIII can imply there is always hope the ""good"" and ""right"" may prevail over ""evil"" and ""wrong."" This will happen with a competent and comprehensive programme to address fraud and corruption in public procurement, even in places with very high perceptions of corruption. There are innumerable forms of and venues for corruption; however, by far the most potent remains procurement. This is not a new phenomenon. For example, in the case of the United States, a voluntary disclosure programme of the US Securities and Exchange Commission revealed that 117 of the Fortune 500 companies made more than USD 400 million in ""questionable payments to foreign concerns"" during the first half of the 1970s. The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), which prohibited transnational bribery and the associated tax deductibility, was an attempt to address that problem. As a consequence of the FCPA, the US Department of Commerce figured US firms lost nearly 100 foreign contracts worth USD 45 billion to foreign competitors in 1994-95. That impact was for just one year. One can only imagine the extent of corruption worldwide and its impact on the world economy in general, as well as the peoples of the developing world in particular. As an auditor and investigator for the Asian Development Bank's Anticorruption Unit, I deal daily with accusations of fraud and corruption related to public procurement. Sometimes it is government officials and bureaucratic decision makers complaining against contractors and consultants-the buyers complaining against the suppliers. Other times, the reverse happens, when the suppliers complain against the buyers. Sometimes, the buyers, suppliers, or civil society will complain about a third-party, often those institutions that fund those procurements. The problem with corruption in procurement is that it is very difficult to prove, or indeed disprove. If there were only two parties directly interacting-the consumer and the provider-corruption would never be an issue. Only when there is third party or where the purchaser is really not the consumer or end-user does corruption become an issue. But what is public procurement? It is essentially a business process, with considerations of integrity, accountability and transparency, national interest and effectiveness, but all within a political system. Thus, without political support nothing can change. To lay the blame on government officials and bureaucratic decision makers-the buyers-as the tools through which bribery, fraud, or other corruption is channelled, however, would be inadequate at best. At the same time, if the political will is there but there is insufficient expertise amongst the buyers then, too, nothing can change. What is required is both political will and expertise to generate the right environment to combat corruption in the procurement process. Sometimes the change comes in unexpected ways. The United States launched a programme to reinvent government in 1994, and one of its first tasks was to reform the laws of its procurement system. Obviously, one benefit of this reinvention was increased efficiency in public procurement. A corollary benefit, however, was that by removing bureaucratic obstacles in public procurement, government reduced the incentive for the private sector to cross the line in its attempts to commit fraud or corruption. In 1998, the United Kingdom followed suit and began its own study on Efficiency in Civil Government, which resulted in several improvements in their procurement system. France, too, undertook procurement reforms. Through those measures billions of dollars were saved. So, are major overhauls of bureaucracies necessary to address corruption in public procurement? Certainly that is not the case. There are so many aspects both to procurement and corruption that there will never be one ""best"" method to resolve corruption. But there are some widely accepted principles to address corruption in public procurement, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has used some of these to address fraud and corruption that is perceived, and certainly exists to some immeasurable degree, in its financed projects. These examples illustrate ways in which any institution can understand the environment and establish an appropriate procurement controls; assess existing procurement system controls and risks; strengthen weak procurement accounting and control systems; and share knowledge. © OECD 2005.";;;;Book Chapter;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84909327289

In the last two decades, public procurement regulations have proliferated at both international and national levels, fostering the transparency of procurement procedures and creating a level playing field between suppliers. Presentations of national experiences in China, Hungary and Poland highlighted these efforts to develop consistent legal, institutional and procedural frameworks in public procurement. All participants expressed the shared policy goal of ensuring sound implementation and compliance with regulations through accountability and control mechanisms. However, the principal objective of public procurement systems is to deliver efficiency and ""value for money"" in the use of public funds whilst adhering to the fundamental principles guiding government actions, in particular transparency and nondiscrimination. Discussions indicated a growing awareness that public procurement rules, while they may reduce the number of opportunities for corruption, cannot eliminate them. In recent years, some OECD countries have begun to simplify their procedures after realising that additional regulations did not necessarily prevent corruption and could even hinder the efficiency of the procurement function. Increasing efforts have also been made worldwide to prevent corruption by providing procurement officials with appropriate skills, professional capacity and incentives to help them identify and manage risks for corruption. Procurement officials have been given more flexibility in managing procurements, while being held kept accountable for their actions through the strengthening of accountability and control mechanisms. © OECD 2005.";;;;Book Chapter;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84909242022

In addition, pursuant to Article 11 of the implementing law, the Government was to issue a Legislative Decree2 within 8 months of the entry into force of the law regarding the administrative liability of legal persons. On 8 June 2001, the Italian Government issued the Legislative Decree no. 231/2001. Pursuant to that statute, administrative liability may be attributed to certain bodies for certain criminal offences (including the bribery of foreign public officials). Although the Legislative Decree no. 231/2001 expressly established a form of administrative responsibility, some commentators3 denounced the ""labelling fraud"" allegedly perpetrated by the legislator, sustaining that the statute had actually introduced a criminal form of responsibility. Other commentators4 adopted a more agnostic view, underlining that the new legislation shows some ambiguous features, falling in between administrative and criminal liability. This paper will adopt this second approach, deemed more consistent with the Convention and its Commentaries, which provide for the option of not establishing criminal responsibility for foreign bribery where a Party does not already have criminal responsibility of legal persons in its legal system. Consequently the question arising from the dispute over the ""true"" nature of the responsibility introduced by this statute will not be addressed. While the paper focuses on disqualification from participating in public procurement as a sanction to legal persons involved in corruption, a brief examination of the principal characteristics of the statute will be necessary to understand fully the legal framework into which the aforementioned sanction fits. © OECD 2005.";;;"Sacerdoti, G., (2001) Responsabilità D'impresa E Strumenti Internazionali Anticorruzione, , Dalla Convenzione OCSE 1997 al Decreto n°231/; Musco, E., Le Imprese a Scuola di Responsabilitàtra Pene Pecuniarie E Misure Interdittive, (23), p. 8. , Dir. e Giust; Alessandri, Riflessioni penalistiche sulla nuova disciplina (2001) La Responsabilità Amministrativa Degli Enti, (231). , A.

The study includes 18 countries, but this report limits itself to eight of them. The methodology applied begins from a particular standpoint: The main significance of a public procurement regulation lies in the fact that it establishes the manner in which economic exchanges take place in the public market. What is regulated is the economic order, and that fact justifies studying regulations from the perspective of their allocative efficiency. One of the causes of economic inefficiency is corruption. As a crucial interface between the public and private sectors, public procurement (PP) is particularly vulnerable to distortions aimed at favouring particular suppliers. Public officials use the rules to restrict the participation of interested firms and direct the outcome to someone. In virtually all cases such interventions happen in return for a bribe. Much turns round the discretionary powers of the public agent. The more they are able to establish the conditions affecting the PP, the more opportunities there are for them to use such powers to manipulate information and bias the procedure. Their ability to decide comes directly from the regulations. By-products of bribery in procurement are overpricing, substandard goods and services, unfinished projects, unnecessary works and many other waste-generating effects. Competition among firms is replaced by a stratified system of cartelised groups arranged by size and specialties. Partitioning of markets and price-fixing are stimulated. Firms become prisoners of a pecking order and are forced to play a game in which big players hold the trumps. Sectors subjected to such market distortions cannot evolve healthfully. Innovation and personnel training are stifled, because cost-saving efforts cannot compete with the unfair advantages given to others. Concentration limits the creation of jobs. Therefore, corruption in procurement harms competition.2 The converse is usually also held3 - That one remedy against corruption is to enhance competition. Environments prone to bribery have a high probability of becoming totally compromised. In Weber Abramo (2003a) it is shown that if one single participant has a certain propensity to bribe in order to win contracts, then for the other participants it becomes irrational not to bribe. As participants tend to try to get the upper hand over others, the equilibrium is unstable and the propensity of tenders to become affected by bribery tends to 100% over time. It is also shown that prevention is more effective than detection/punishment to achieve better efficiency and less corruption, and that the regulations must evolve continuously because participants in the market are not passive bystanders, but actively seek ways round the legal strictures in order to win contracts. Actually measuring in monetary terms the economic efficiency of a whole country's public procurement environment would entail collecting a representative sample of (unit) prices for a representative set of goods and services purchased by a representative set of state institutions and comparing them with those of other countries', suitable segments of the private sector or both, all this compensating for an array of local variables possibly affecting the prices. Although not impossible in principle, such a de facto assessment would not be feasible in practice. Instead, we try to assess the presumable (de jure) inefficiency of a country's regulation stemming from the rules governing its public market. The presumable inefficiency is mainly (although not exclusively) identified with the inefficiency of the flow of information from the state to participants (and the public in general) and viceversa in tenders, as imposed by the regulations. To do this, a set of qualitative conditions was defined and each country's regulatory framework parsed to assess its compliance with the requirements defined by the conditions. Good public procurement regulations are a necessary condition for achieving efficiency in the public market. Environments in which PP regulations are lax and vulnerable cannot possibly lead to overall efficiency and honesty. Tenders will probably be biased, because the opportunity is there to be taken. As the propensity for efficiency in a PP set of regulations is here identified to the degree it enhances competition, this puts a heavy burden on the market itself. Participants must be up to the task of using the power of the regulation to guarantee their rights and defend themselves against opportunistic attacks. However, a good PP regulation is not a sufficient condition for efficiency - because the laws might simply not be enforced, or the judiciary might not function very well, or for numerous other reasons. Foremost among these are market failures - That is, situations in which the participants do not act according to economic rationality. This happens for instance in cartelised markets, in markets dominated by oligopolistic interests, etc. Thus in such cases, even when the regulations are healthy, broader economic inefficiencies hamper the efficiency of the public markets. This is an important dimension of the environment in many developing countries. A central contention of this note is that achieving the healthiest PP regulation possible should be the first and foremost priority of those who strive for better economic conditions in public markets.4 In this case the goal is an urgent one, as the panorama stemming from the study is bleak. In almost all cases, one is forced to conclude that it is unlikely that public procurement conducted in the countries in question can be efficient and/or honest. No attempt was made to use the findings of the study to place countries in a ranking. Although doing so would be straightforward (modulo decisions as to weights attributed to conditions), it would cast the study into an unintended frame of competition among countries. Although for some there is a commercial-driven interest in comparing countries' environments, for those who live in those countries what matters is how much the state is able to avoid waste not only in international tenders, but also (and principally) in its day-to-day purchases. In any country, far more resources go into the run-of-the mill operation of the state than into big projects. This paper looks at the process after the decision to launch a project was taken; it does not address the conditions whereby such decisions are reached. Execution is not addressed. Regulations for concessions and public-private partnerships were not included in the study. Some countries have special laws for public works; these are taken into account here. © OECD 2005.";;;"Compte, O., Jehiel, P., On the value of competition in procurement auctions (2002) Econometrica, 70, pp. 343-355; Ganuza, J.-J., Hauk, E., Economic integration and corruption: The corrupt soul of the European union Working Paper (2001), Department of Economics and Business, , Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Spain); Mauro, P., Corruption and growth (1995) Quarterly Journal of Economics, 110 (3), pp. 681-712; Corruption and the composition of government expenditure (1998) Journal of Public Economics, 69, pp. 263-279; Rose-Ackerman, S., Redesigning the state to fight corruption (1996) Public Policy for Private Sector, , The World Bank; (1999) Corruption and Government, Causes, Consequences and Reform, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Søreide, T., (2002) Corruption in Public Procurement-Causes, Consequences and Cures, 1. , Report R, Bergen (No): Chr.

For example, dealings of people in charge of building maintenance with electricians, elevator manufacturers, plumbers, etc. often give rise to favouritism and direct or indirect bribery. Similarly, business literature is replete with stories of procurement officers in business firms being bribed by suppliers. Yet, in a number of countries there is a perception that corruption is a more important problem in public procurement than in private procurement. A number of reasons may explain this perception. •First, public procurements tend to involve larger and more visible orders (e.g. hospitals, railways, planes, bridges, power plants) than private procurement markets. Thus, even if the frequency of corruption were the same in both types of procurement markets, its magnitude in financial terms on public procurement markets would seem to be more striking.•Second, governments may have more complex ""objective functions"" than private parties awarding contracts through a tender process. Local governments, for example, may be particularly sensitive to political issues such as local employment, the promotion of regional firms, distributing work evenly among local suppliers etc. even if some of these objectives, because they are not based on technical or efficiency considerations, cannot always be explicitly acknowledged as criteria of choice in the design of the procurement markets or the selection of the bidders or of the winning bid. As a result, the way in which government procurements are awarded may seem to be less transparent than the way in which private contracts are awarded. This fuels the suspicion that corruption is more of a problem for public procurement markets than private procurement markets.•Third, there is a suspicion, in some countries, that the allegedly low level of income of civil servants may prompt them to engage more frequently than private sector employees in corrupt practices to achieve a level of earnings similar to the private sector.•Fourth, in many countries there is a special concern about the possibility of abuse of power by public offices holders. In these countries, public procurement markets are more closely scrutinised than private procurement markets. As a result, even if the level of corruption were the same in both types of markets, more cases of corruption would therefore be discovered in public procurement markets.•Fifth, in many countries the ability of political parties (and elected officials) to raise political funds legally is severely restricted even though there are clear indications that the ability to survive political challenges crucially depends on the resources of political parties. Thus, there is a particular form of pressure on office holders to use the awarding of public contracts to secure economic favours (e.g. transportation, advertising, monetary donations, the building of facilities such as swimming pools, parking lots, etc.) which will enable them to stay in office. • Lastly, one reason to focus on corruption in public procurements while paying comparatively less attention to corrupt practices on private procurement markets may simply be that there is a general feeling that governments have a particular responsibility to eradicate those practices on public procurement markets. They have the ability to do so through public policy means such as the enactment of particular rules and procedures for the design of public procurement markets whereas they have both fewer means and less responsibility to regulate private procurement markets. © OECD 2005.";;;;Book Chapter;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84908971284

Considering the key sectors of construction, especially large infrastructure projects like bridges, tunnels, motorways, railways, harbours and underground systems; or engineering in a broader sense, including power stations, hydroelectric dams, mining infrastructure or oil and gas equipment, it is easy to discern the dimensions of the projects we are talking about. One would need to add defence contracting and civil aeronautics, again key areas where state procurement agencies are involved. Both in developed and in developing countries, the risk of manipulation is considerable. Multilateral lending agencies, international organisations and regional economic organisations have developed detailed procurement rules. Nation states have implemented them. Until now, the primary focus of procurement rules has been to secure the best value for money. Only gradually did it become obvious that the prevention of bribery is one of the fundamental concerns in ascertaining that the best and the relatively priciest bidder get the job rather than the best rent-seeker. © OECD 2005.";;;"Chair of the OECD Working Group on Bribery in International Business Transactions Professor of Criminal Law, University of Basel, Switzerland; (1999) International Trade Corruption Monitor (ITCM), pp. 10-69. , Travaux préparatoires for the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions";Book Chapter;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84908951868

Not surprisingly, it attracts many criminals who try to channel parts of this money into their own pockets. These criminals are among the officials who award and supervise contracts, the individuals and companies who seek to obtain contracts for themselves or act as agents for others, and those who execute such contracts. In cases of corruption, there is usually collusion among them. Therefore, any efforts to develop laws, rules, regulations and structures to ensure compliance with anti-corruption laws and thus to minimise corruption and its adverse consequences must address both the side of the public office (a government department or public agency, here called the ""principal"") as well as the side of the bidder or contractor, whether consultant, supplier or civil works contractor.

In 2003, the amount of public spending for procurement contracts was LVL 501 million,1 (approximately EUR 790 939 000 or USD 863 691 000) an amount approximately equal to one-fourth of the state budget. Considering the large sums of state and municipal government funds at stake, the potential for corruption in public procurement and means to prevent and detect wrongdoing in public procurement are extremely important issues. In Latvia, procurement procedures are specified by two pieces of legislation. The Law on Procurement for State or Local Government Needs, which came into effect in 2002, outlines procedures for public procurement. Law 257, Procurement Regulations for the Needs of Public Services Providers specifies procedures for granting contracts for services, supplies and construction works for public services providers (e.g. water works, electricity, gas, public transport and postal services), where ""public"" refers to a company where the state or a municipality holds at least 50% of the enterprise's assets.2 These regulations, issued by the Cabinet of Ministers, meet the requirements of the European Parliament and Directive 2004/17/EK.3 In order to receive European Union Structural Funds or Latvian state resources, private persons are required to follow the procedures specified in relevant legislation to ensure transparency in procurement and the most advantageous tenders for the lowest price, thus ensuring effective use of funds. There are two institutions involved in monitoring compliance with the laws and regulations in the area of public procurement in Latvia, the Procurement Monitoring Bureau (PMB) and the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (CPCB). The PMB was established in 2002 upon the enactment of the Law on Procurement for State or Local Government Needs. Its main mandate is to monitor compliance with the laws and regulations in the areas of public procurement and procurement for the needs of public services providers. The PMB is the initial point of contact for bidders and others who file complaints or suspicions of wrongdoings in the procurement process. It organises educational workshops to raise awareness on public procurement legislation and provides methodological support to contracting authorities. The CPCB detects and examines violations of procedure in public procurement. It conducts further investigations of complaints passed on by the PMB and other sources. Its Division for Examination of State and Municipal Affairs, created in January 2003, works together with the PMB to monitor compliance with the Law on Procurement for State or Local Government Needs. It also examines other state and municipal institutions' affairs, including the use or lease of public property. © OECD 2005.";;;"Latvian lats. 0.63342466 LVL = 1 EUR, 0.58006849 LVL = 1 USD.

Clearly, a primary goal is to obtain goods or services at the best possible price. Further objectives include, inter alia, efficiency and probity in the procurement process and fair and equal treatment of providers. Other primary goals may be to support industrial, social and environmental policies, to name a few. Public procurement lies at the crossroad of the public and the private sectors. Consequently, it provides a multitude of opportunities for corruption, i.e., for making government decisions based on interests or objectives which are not recognised as 'legitimate' in the procurement process. The primary goals of public procurement are generally reflected in the legal provisions promulgated by States to control the award of contracts. Increasingly, countries must ensure that officials involved in the procurement process apply domestic legislation in a consistent manner and that the legal framework for procurement and its practical application complies with their country's international commitments. Legal obligations negotiated in regional or international fora are manifold. Some of the international provisions aim at fighting corruption and state capture1 and foresee, as a sanction for corruption, the temporary or permanent denial of access (debarment) from public procurement. This note outlines different issues related to debarment from public tendering, particularly those that arise in a period when the fight against corruption is being internationalised.

In order to prevent corruption throughout the process of establishing and implementing government contracts, a means of punishment for the breach of integrity agreements must be ensured. The Korean Public Procurement Service (PPS) has implemented an Integrity Pact for all contracts since 1 March 2001. The purpose of this pact is to illustrate to the private sector the fact that business values originate from business ethics and to encourage them to join the campaign against corruption. This pact requires businesses and contract officials to pledge that they will not solicit or provide gratuities or entertainment with regard to procurement. A survey of this pact is conducted twice a year and then the results are published. © OECD 2005.;;;;Book Chapter;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84908920086

The three major stakeholders involved in public procurement - elected officials, public procurement officers and contractors - reached a consensus on the need to address grey zones and opportunities for improperly influencing public decision-making arising from the lack of transparency and accountability. Transparency was recognised as one of the most effective deterrents to corruption and a pre-condition for ensuring public officials' accountability. Participants explored innovative approaches and conditions for successfully promoting integrity in public procurement through transparency and accountability mechanisms, not only in the bidding process but also in the definition of needs and contract management. They indicated particular interest in the potential of new information and communication technologies to standardise processes, increase their transparency, improve access to markets, and promote integrity in public bidding. However, the discussions emphasised that transparency and accountability in public procurement must be reconciled with other imperatives, such as providing guarantees for fair competition and ensuring an efficient management of public resources. The OECD was encouraged to take the lead in defining an adequate framework for using information in public procurement by looking more specifically at the different dimensions of transparency, in particular what type of information should be released, to whom and at what stage of the public procurement process. © OECD 2005.;;;;Book Chapter;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84908915894

Workshop discussions and the papers prepared for the workshop, included later in this chapter, illustrated that provisions and practices regulating access to public tendering differ greatly between countries and among international institutions. Participants raised several questions and issues that varied significantly according to the context of the tender procedure and the nature of the tendering authority. Priorities and considerations can depend on whether the bidding procedure involves international organisations, multilateral development banks, international financial institutions, national agencies or communities at a sub-national level and whether tendering authorities are subject to domestic or international law, among other factors. Obviously, at the national level, the issue calls for a detailed analysis of countries legislation in relation to both the definition and sanction of corruption as well as political party financing. Participants also discussed the implementation of voluntary self-regulation measures and how these contribute to preventing corruption. © OECD 2005.;;;;Book Chapter;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84898742531

No matter how hard we try, whether through individual or collective efforts, to find it, and no matter how well we think we are controlling and fighting it, everyone knows corruption will occur, somehow, somewhere, to some degree. The innovation and creativity of the corrupt simply make it too hard to stop completely. So a discussion of fighting corruption in public procurement is not complete just addressing what to do to prevent or detect corruption in public procurement. The discussion needs to also address what happens when we find it. Penalties are an essential deterrent. Most, if not all countries' legal and judicial systems provide for a penalty for fraud or corruption. Multilateral institutions have administrative penalties to punish transgressors. ADB's Anticorruption Unit has dealt with some difficult cases that resulted in debarment-ineligibility-of more than 200 individuals and firms. There is nothing purposely malevolent about our actions. If we conclude, for example, that a company has violated our Anticorruption Policy, we ask the company to first explain its actions. Many firms take actions that assure us the same violation is unlikely to recur, which is considered when ADB determines the firm's penalty. And that's where our strength lies: A desire to ensure that, if possible, the firm does not fold, but seeks to meet the broadly accepted criteria that would allow more contracts for it in the future, and indeed more jobs for the people. At ADB, we have tried to carefully balance the desire to punish with the better interest to reform. Punishment is not easy to implement. Last year, there was an interesting article in the International Herald Tribune for which the headline was, ""A Clear-Cut Decision Isn't So Clear Anymore."" It talked about a German company that had supplied poison gas to the Nazis being prevented, 60 years later, from participating as a subcontractor for a holocaust memorial. Some of the most important questions raised in that article were: Was the memorial's board correct to punish the firm? Why should one firm be singled out for penalty, when so many others committed similar acts? At what point does a company earn exoneration for its past behaviour? In this case, 60 years had passed since its transgressions. This is the difficult situation that institutions like ADB find themselves in. They are seeking to curb corruption while at the same time ensure that government and civil society are interested enough to partner such efforts. That way lies the future policy; however, in the interim we need to be more proactive in dealing with corruption wherever we find it, and more importantly are able to identify it. Is voluntary self-regulation enough? Can a reform agenda without ownership by all stakeholders be successful? Where ownership is limited to periodic rhetorical comments for reasons to do with powerful pressure groups that support the status quo, there is not likely much meaningful self-regulation. Yet penalties, whether criminal, civil, or administrative, for those who commit fraud and corruption, may jeopardise the entity's very existence. The question then arises as to what one ought to do. If sanctions are not effective and if voluntary self-regulation is not forthcoming then what is the ideal way to stop stakeholders from continuing to disregard public opinion for their narrow selfinterest? ADB has tried to balance all these factors to address fraud and corruption in its projects, the majority of which is related to public procurement. The investigation and sanction process can be completed in days, if necessary. Usually it takes months-often the better part of a year. And sometimes it takes more than a year. © OECD 2005.";;;;Book Chapter;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84898733034

Given the amounts involved, public procurement contracts require particular attention in order to prevent misappropriation. Corruption is not the rule in public procurement, however. It is caused by a limited number of dishonest public officials and business people seeking to obtain personal advantage. The potential risk of corruption may be greater in international procurement than in domestic procurement, especially because of the value of contracts and the number and variety of players involved. Finally, it may be noted that in many cases of corruption which come to justice, regulatory means have been deflected from their true purpose. Various mechanisms used to camouflage corruption in public procurement are reviewed in the first part of this paper. The second part, drawing on the understanding of risks specific to the different stages of the public procurement process, considers possible preventive measures. Various techniques that facilitate the misappropriation of funds are described in Annex 21.A. Questions are raised throughout the paper to encourage reflection on other types of fraud and corruption, further means of preventing corruption and identifying factors indicative of corruption. © OECD 2005.;;;;Book Chapter;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84890410914

The paper also outlines the role of new technologies in fostering transparency and raises questions on specific points for reflection and discussion. Corruption is most likely to occur in a situation where agents enjoy discretionary power over the provision of goods or services and a low level of accountability. Therefore, information plays a crucial role and transparency is a major tool for preventing corruption and ensuring accountability of public officials. © OECD 2005.;;;"(2003) Increasing Competition and Improving Long-Term Capacity Planning in the Government Market Place, , http://www.ogc.gov.uk/embedded_object.asp?docid=1001394, Report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer; (2003) OECD, , http://www.oecd.org/gov/ethics, The Guidelines were approved in the form of a Recommendation by the, Council in June, The Guidelines and the Toolkit can be consulted at; http://e-pubpro.com/compendium/, The compendium may be consulted on the ITC web site";Book Chapter;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84876074459

There is also some evidence to the effect that corruption has increased following the collapse of communism and the introduction of the market1 and that it is still on the rise. 2 Measures aimed at reducing corruption in EU applicant states introduced as part of the ""acquis"", appear to have had a limited impact not only in the new EU member states but also in the EU applicant states Bulgaria and Romania. Although the new EU member states, Bulgaria and Romania have introduced new and comprehensive legislation on public procurement in recent years, corruption in procurement remains a serious problem - And one for which it is proving difficult to find adequate solutions. There are of course a number of reasons for this4, all of which act as brakes on anti-corruption reform. The major problem, however, seems to be that measures aimed at reducing corruption not only in public procurement but also elsewhere, have failed to address what is sometimes referred to as a ""culture of informality"", left over from communism. According to Ledeneva ""it is not that the components of the rule of law are absent. Rather, the ability of the rule of law to function coherently has been subverted by a powerful set of practices that has evolved organically in the postcommunist milieu."" This chapter offers examples of how that ""culture of informality"" manifests itself in public procurement - more specifically, of how contacts and informal networks are used to influence the outcome of public tenders - presenting preliminary findings from 120 indepth interviews with business representatives and public procurement officials in Prague, Ljubljana, Sofia and Bucharest during the winter 2003/04. The interviews6 were carried out as part of a three-year project investigating how the culture of informality manifests itself not just in public procurement, but also in political party funding, lobbying and the judiciary in the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania.

If the propensities to corruption are too different, the more honest country, which benefits less from integration, will not be willing to join the union.

In such circumstances concession is based on a complex contract which mixes a range of public licenses to occupy a State property and to use an industrial patent on the one hand ; a range of public delegations in order to work utilities with special sovereign rights (monopoly, delegated regulation, exclusive rights) on the other hand. A concession system combines accordingly carrying out public works, a commercial or an industrial trade and carrying out public prerogatives in exerting police regulations aimed at managing these utilities with a view to fulfilling and achieving social and political purposes. This system face challenges nowadays and is situated at crossroads that condition its future. Two topical influences may question the political importance that such concessions or such contracts may reveal as a legal implementation of a public policy initiated by the government and local authorities and enforced by statutory companies with exclusive rights. The first influence comes from European law constructed by the Commission and the Court of Justice. In order to give a full, complete and useful effect to EC-objectives (« l'effet utile »), and specially the so-called « economic four liberties » (goods, services, persons, capital), this concession system how immaterial to European regulation it may be apparently, must comply with an economic and comprehensive approach deriving from competition as far as the State as a contracting per son for goods, services and investments at large is concerned. From an European point of view concession actually must amount to a mere confrontation of a mere demand written by a mere buyer - even a State-owned one, or an authority - and a mere offer presented by companies put at the same level of competition without discrimination (nationality, competence, legal position). This compliance is deducted from Commission Green or White Papers and communications on public purchase orders (for instance, communication on concessions, April 29, 2000), and Court of Justice decree (mainly Telaustria case, December 7th, 2000) concerning EC regulations on tenders organised by public bodies or concerning public essential facilities. But such a compliance faces a sharp criticism too, raised by French politicians (through the « reciprocity » theme) and experts in laws governing relationship between public authorities and citizens or private body corporates (« la doctrine du droit administratif »). They underline and stress their criticism on an European bias towards a short term approach derived from international conglomerates' experience on the one hand, an European way of ignoring the State as an organizer of economic life through purchase orders and tenders on the other hand. On the contrary they explain tliat a concession system is mainly aimed at a long term policy which consists of an investment organisation in order to fulfil much more than plain economic objectives. In other words, they say concession means a priority-way of State intervention, combines with State managed companies or industries and finally implements « service public » objectives. The second influence comes from internal law in the way it deals with self- government principles as far as local authorities are concerned. A double trend is newly seen through a set of laws pertaining contracts signed by these authorities and through case-laws given by the highest administrative jurisdiction (« le Conseil d'État ») in the way it defines and describes a concession system. This trend leads to a reduction of powers entitled and exerted by local authorities organizing economic life. In other words, these law restricting freedom of contracting for fear of new forms of corruption (mainly, « loi Sapin », January 29""', 1993), these case-laws reducing the genuiness of a « service public » concession (Conseil d'État, decree « Compagnie luxembourgeoise de télévision », April 16""', 1986) have questioned the way these local authorities chose their statutory company for a long term contractwithout organising a competitive examination through tenders and contract specifications (i.e. a choice from « intuitu personae »). More than this, all these internal laws and case-laws meet and are suitable with these European requirements of transparency, non-discrimination imposed by EC regulations and directives on public bodies dealing with companies and strengthen such a reduction in freedom of contracting at the expense of local authorities. Critics question the consistency of this second (European ) trendviewedas a « banalisation » of concession system joined to a variant of a public tender - « délégation de service public » -, with constitutional principles.";;;;;;;;

Its mandate was reinforced at the fourth ministerial Conference in Doha (2001 ) in view of launching negotiations on transparency at the next ministerial Conference by explicit consensus. Aspects referring to market access would not be covered, each Member being able to keep its own regimes to grant preferences to local suppliers. This article analyses first the major results of the Working Group on Transparency in Government Procurement in order to identify areas of convergence and divergence. Common views are registered for the key transparency procedures linked to tenders. Major difficulties refer to coverage, national remedies and WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism. Without such rules, the effectiveness of transparency risks to be seriously limited. Positions differ also significantly regarding the scope of the rules - transparency only or transparency and implementation of the rules - as well as the treatment of the linkages between government procurement and other policy areas.Second, the preliminary results of the full revision of the WTO plurilateral Agreement on Government Procurement are reviewed. The negotiations aim at simplifying, clarifying, updating the present GPA as well as improving developing countries' access. Particular emphasis is set on shortening the tender procedures as well as devising new provisions referring to withdrawal of entities from the coverage of the Agreement. Market access negotiations and abolition of discriminatory measures should lead to further liberalisation. Third, the options for the future are reviewed. Following the Decision of the WTO General Council of August 1, 2004 re-launching the Doha Round, negotiations of an agreement on transparency in government procurement will not take place under the Doha Programme due to strong opposition by several developing countries. They do not want their policy flexibility to be restrained by WTO rules. For the after-Doha era, an agreement lacking a national remedy system or the WTO dispute settlement mechanism would run the risk of not bearing much result. Various authors emphasize that without a strong commitment from national authorities to apply rigorously rules andfight corruption, it may be difficult to achieve significant practical results. The article concl udes that, at present, accession to the new GPA may be the best option for developing countries favourable to multilateral rules on transparency because it would include a national remedy system, the WTO dispute settlement mechanism and a progressive liberalisation at the international level.;;;"1.Pour une analyse des raisons de l'échec, voir WaseschaL., Pourquoi la Conférence ministérielle de l'OMC a-t-elle échoué La Vie économique, 2003, 12, pp. 56-58; Le but d'un point de contact est de pouvoir centraliser des demandes d'information et d'y répondre rapidement; Cet article utilisera l'abréviation CE pour les Communautés européennes; « éléments pour un accord sur la transparence dans les marchés publics », Communication des Communautés européennes, 5 novembre 1999, Groupe de travail de la transparence des marchés publics, WT/WGTGP/W/26; Ces valeurs s'élèvent à 130 000 DTS pour les biens et services des gouvernementaux centraux ; 200 000 DTS pour les gouvernementaux sous-centraux ; 400 000 DTS pour les entreprises publiques ; et 5 000 000 DTS pour les travaux de construction.

Potential bidders have private information about their production costs. Since the procurement agent is also in charge of verifying delivered quality, in exchange for a bribe, he can allow an arbitrary firm to be awarded the realization of the project and to produce a quality level lower than that announced. We compute equilibrium corruption and we study the impact on corruption of the competitiveness of the environment, and in particular of: (i) an increase in the number of potential suppliers of the good or service to be procured, and (ii) an increase of competition in the market for procurement agents. We identify the effects that influence equilibrium corruption and show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, corruption may well be increasing in competition. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

While mainly concentrating on the bureaucratic administration, the discussion often includes the political level. Three aspects of procurement-related corruption have been examined. First, problems that often arise if this type of corruption is common. Secondly, the mechanisms: How is this illegal activity actually carried out? And finally, a major concern of the study is the practical strategies to combat the problem. This section also includes a discussion of the responsibility and regulation of private companies, and emphasises political commitment as a necessary condition for successful reform.;;"bureaucracy; corruption; public administration; public service";"Ades, A., Di Tella, R., Rents, competition and corruption (1999) American Economic Review, 89 (4), pp. 982-994; (2001) Relatório de evolução do projecto, , AIP AIP unpublished paper of the 24th of May 2001, Luanda; Amundsen, I., (1999) Political Corruption: An Introduction to the Issues, , Chr.

That status quo is currently challenged by changing views of the role of the State in the economy, increases in cross-border trade brought about by the single market, the information revolution, and new currents of public awareness, expressed in political demands for decentralization, for greater priority for the protection of the environment and for the elimination of corruption. Following recent studies and consultations, the Commission has now presented a balanced strategy for the opening-up of public procurement, which promises: better enforcement of the existing rules; clarification or amendment of the directives in the interest of simplification and adaptation to new ways of carrying out procurement (particularly in the areas of negotiation, framework agreements and concessions and other forms of public-private partnership); and promotion of information and training, with a specific commitment to electronic procurement and a strong emphasis on the promotion of professionalism and best practice. Successful pursuit of these activities will depend on Member States and the major economic and training actors, and not just the Commission.This paper briefly reviews the response of the European Commission to changes in the environment in which public procurement now takes place, compared with that reflected in the existing Community public procurement directives whose basic provisions are now more than ten years old.

Successful pursuit of these activities will depend on Member States and the major economic and training actors, and not just the Commission.";Arbitration, Contracts, Law;"Contracts; Environmental protection; Laws and legislation; Public procurement; Public works; legislation; planning practice; Europe";"(1998) 143 Final Adopted by the Commission on 11 March; Exploring the way Forward (COM (96 583 final)) Green Paper.; The Single Market Review, Subscrics HI: Dismantling of Barriers, Volume 2: Public Procurement (1996) Ol'OCE; The basic code consists of directives covering public works (consolidated in 93/37/EEC), supplies (consolidated in 93/36/EEC), services (92/50/EEC) and utilities (consolidated in 9S/38/ EEC) Remedies for Works and Supplies Are Covered in, 86, p. 92. , /665/EEC and for utilities in /13/ EEC; 88/295/EEC adopted 2.03.1988, in force since 1.01.1989, consolidated in 93/36/EEC (see Reference 4); note; note; See in particular Council Directive 89/665/EEC of 21 December 1989 (OJ No. L 395/33 of 30.12.89); EN 45503; (1998) Official Journal of the European Union; note";Short Survey;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-0032750317

As a result, two new legal instruments have been put forward to harmonise the treatment, in the laws of the Member States, of corrupt officials handling EC funds and to improve judicial and other forms of cooperation. The author argues this can only be seen as the first step in the fight against corruption. Cooperation will remain a crucial issue in tackling corruption successfully for the foreseeable future. The protection of informants, and the lifting of officials' immunities will also need to be clarified. © 1996, MCB UP Limited;;;"Leuprecht, P., Opening Statement in Administrative, Civil and Penal Aspects, Including the Role of the Judiciary, of the Fight Against Corruption (1995) Proceedings of the Nineteenth Conference of European Ministers of Justice, Valetta, Malta, , 14—15th June, 1994, Council of Europe, Strasbourg; Belgian ex-minister sentenced (1996), p. 2. , April; Bassi, A., Community Frauds upon the ESF: The Italian Experience in the Legal Protection of the Financial Interests of the Community: Progress and Prospects since the Brussels Seminar of 1989 (1993), pp. 225-230. , European Commission, Oak Trees Press, Dublin; Battistotti, L., Protection des interets financiers et fonds structurels (1995), unpublished paper given at Bilbao Conference, 24th March, 1995; Hungary sold short by black market (1996) Financial Times, p. 2. , 6th April; (1994) Recommendation of the Council on Bribery in International Business Transactions, , (1994) adopted by the Council on 27th May; (1995) Multidisciplinary Group on Corruption, Draft Programme of Action Against Corruption, , GMC (95) 49 Final, Strasbourg; (1995) The Fight Against International Corruption: What the European Union Can Do, , November, mimeo; (1995) L312, on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests, , Council Regulation 2988/95 OJ; (1995) Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests OJ, , C316/48; (1995) Draft Protocol to the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests, JUSTPEN 167, , 8th December; Whistle Blowing, Fraud and the European Union (1996) Public Concern at Work, Lincoln's Inn House, , 42 Kingsway, London WC2B 6EX; Top diplomat in EC enquiry (1995) European, , 15th February; Immunity lifted on EC suspects (1995) European, , 24th February; EC antifraud chief pledges “no cover-ups” (1996) European, , 10th March; d'Aubert, F., Main basse sur l'Europe (1994), p. 395. , Plon, Paris; (1995), ref. 8 above; Flynn, (1994), 11th November, 1994 C36/39";Review;Final;;Scopus;2-s2.0-84992933856

However, it is difficult to measure the magnitude of such effects because the appropriate data are usually not available. In this paper a new approach to comparing prices is explored using individual firm data which are typically available. If the firms in different markets can be assumed to use the same technology, price differentials can be inferred from the estimates can be assumed to use the same technology, price differentials can be inferred from the estimates of best practice frontiers. The new approach is applied to data on the Swiss construction industry in different cantons. In some cantons the market can be said to be competitive, in others non-competitive procurement rules are expected to raise equilibrium prices. The data envelopment analysis estimates the price differential to be approximately equal to 7.5%. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.;Data envelopment analysis, equilibrium prices, H57, L5, L74, public procurement;;"Bauer, Recent Development in the Econometric Estimation of Frontiers (1990) Journal of Econometrics, 46, pp. 39-56; Chamberlain, Multivariate Regression Models for Panel Data (1982) Journal of Econometrics, 18, pp. 5-46; Charnes, A., Cooper, W.W., Preface to Topics in Data Envelopment Analysis (1985) Annals of Operations Research, 2, pp. 59-94; Charnes, A., Cooper, W.W., Rhodes, R.M., Measuring the Efficiency of Decision Making Units (1978) Euroopean Journal of Operational Research, 2, pp. 429-444; Farrell, M.J., The Measurement of Productive Efficiency (1957) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
