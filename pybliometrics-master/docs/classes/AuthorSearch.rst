pybliometrics.scopus.AuthorSearch
=================================

`AuthorSearch()` implements the `Author Search API <https://dev.elsevier.com/documentation/AuthorSearchAPI.wadl>`_.  It performs a query to search for authors and then retrieves the records of the query.

Examples

The class is initialized with a search query which you can read about in `Author Search Guide <https://dev.elsevier.com/tips/AuthorSearchTips.htm>`_.  An invalid search query will result in an error.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from pybliometrics.scopus import AuthorSearch
    >>> s = AuthorSearch('AUTHLAST(Selten) and AUTHFIRST(Reinhard)')


You can obtain a search summary just by printing the object:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> print(s)
    Search 'AUTHLAST(Selten) and AUTHFIRST(Reinhard)' yielded 2 authors as of 2021-11-12:
        Selten, Reinhard; AUTHOR_ID:6602907525 (74 document(s))
        Selten, Reinhard; AUTHOR_ID:57213632570 (1 document(s))


To know the the number of results use the `.get_results_size()` method, even before you download the results:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> other = AuthorSearch("AUTHLAST(Selten)", download=False)
    >>> other.get_results_size()
    29


The class mostly provides a list of `namedtuples <https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple>`_ storing author EIDs, which you can use for the :doc:`AuthorRetrieval <../classes/AuthorRetrieval>` class, and corresponding information:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s.authors[0]
    [Author(eid='9-s2.0-6602907525', orcid=None, surname='Selten', initials='R.',
     givenname='Reinhard', affiliation='Universitat Bonn', documents=74,
     affiliation_id='60007493', city='Bonn', country='Germany',
     areas='ECON (73); MATH (19); BUSI (16)')]


It's easy to work with namedtuples: Using `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, you can quickly turn the results set into a DataFrame:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
    >>> print(pd.DataFrame(s.authors))
                      eid orcid surname initials givenname  \
    0   9-s2.0-6602907525  None Selten       R.  Reinhard
    1  9-s2.0-57213632570  None Selten       R.  Reinhard

                         affiliation  documents affiliation_id     city  country  \
    0               UniversitÃ¤t Bonn         74       60007493     Bonn  Germany   
    1  Southwest Jiaotong University          1       60010421  Chengdu    China   

                                 areas  
    0  ECON (73); MATH (19); BUSI (16)  
    1                         COMP (3)


Downloaded results are cached to speed up subsequent analysis.  This information may become outdated.  To refresh the cached results if they exist, set `refresh=True`, or provide an integer that will be interpreted as maximum allowed number of days since the last modification date.  For example, if you want to refresh all cached results older than 100 days, set `refresh=100`.  Use `s.get_cache_file_mdate()` to get the date of last modification, and `s.get_cache_file_age()` the number of days since the last modification.

There are sometimes missing information in the returned results although it exists in the Scopus database.  For example, the EID may be missing, even though every element always has an EID.  This is not a bug of `pybliometrics`.  Instead it is somehow related to a problem in the download process from the Scopus database.  To check for completeness of specific fields, use parameter `integrity_fields`, which accepts any iterable.  Using parameter `integrity_action` you can choose between two actions on what to do if the integrity check fails: Set `integrity_action="warn"` to issue a UserWarning, or set `integrity_action="raise"` to raise an AttributeError.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> s = AuthorSearch("AUTHLAST(Selten)", integrity_fields=["eid"], integrity_action="warn")


If you search for authors by institution, note that searching by affiliation profile ID and affiliaton name behave differently.  Search by affiliation name, i.e. `AFFIL(Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition)`), finds all authors *ever* affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition, whereas search by affiliation profile ID, i.e. `AF-ID(60105007)`, finds researchers whose latest affiliation includes the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition.
