To access the Scopus database using `pybliometrics`, get an API key from http://dev.elsevier.com/myapikey.html.  On first usage, `pybliometrics` prompts you for authentication details and stores them in `~/.scopus/config.ini`, where you can change it manually (see :doc:`Configuration </configuration>`).  If your institution subscribes to Scopus, you may need to be in your institution's network or you need to have an InstToken, which can also be saved in the configuration.  Non-subscribers only get limited access to two APIs.  See more on that at https://dev.elsevier.com/api_key_settings.html.
